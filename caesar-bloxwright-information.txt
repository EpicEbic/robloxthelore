PERSONALITY & MANNERISMS
================================================================================

STANDARD PERSONALITY:
Caesar is a walking definition of both empathy and resolve. He is a loyal 
protector whose heart is as strong as his fists, carrying a deep-rooted sense of 
love and loyalty for those he values. He is very down-to-earth and quick-witted, 
usually capable of remaining calm under decent amounts of pressure. In most cases, 
he'll often adopt a protective role towards his family and friends, going as far 
as to throw his life on the line if a dire situation deems it necessary. His 
sense of self-preservation is weak so long as someone who matters to him is at 
risk.

Key Mannerisms:
- Extremely empathetic and caring
- Quick-witted and down-to-earth
- Remains calm under pressure
- Protective nature toward loved ones
- Willing to sacrifice himself for others
- Values family and friends deeply
- Respectful by nature
- Kindhearted disposition

POWER ABUSE STATE (Berserk):
As Caesar pushes the limits of both his body and abilities, the strain and sheer 
power causes him to lose his composure, as sanity slips away from his mind. In 
desperate situations such as these, Caesar has a tendency to enter a berserk-like 
state, drastically altering his behavior and personality.

The previously-witty and mindful Caesar is replaced with bloodlust, blind rage 
and sadism. The thrill of combat usurps his mind and body, as he'll relentlessly 
and violently assault his opponents using reckless tactics and unrefined 
techniques. While Caesar retains enough of his mentality to avoid intentionally 
bringing harm to his loved ones or allies, his reckless behavior makes him a 
danger to his immediate surroundings due to the volatile and destructive nature 
of his abilities.

In most cases, Caesar's rampage will either end after the target has been 
defeated, he becomes exhausted/incapacitated, or is calmed down by another 
Bloxian. Regardless of how it ends, Caesar often laments and reflects negatively 
on his behavior, finding it unbecoming and degrading.

Berserk State Mannerisms:
- Bloodlust and blind rage
- Sadistic behavior
- Reckless and violent assault tactics
- Unrefined techniques
- Danger to immediate surroundings
- Post-rampage regret and reflection


================================================================================
LIFESTYLE
================================================================================

AT HOME:
Despite the potential to live a lavish and rich lifestyle, Caesar prefers to 
live humbly on an empty island belonging only to him. He'll happily spend his 
days wandering the island on long walks, or catering to one of his many gardens. 
He enjoys the quiet, lounging around in the sun or the moonlight, spending time 
with his friends in peace. Even if problems happen to arise in his daily living, 
most are trivialized by his overwhelming strength and abilities. If enemy 
Bloxians weren't frequently invading his World, Caesar's life truly would be one 
of luxury.

Daily Activities:
- Long walks around his island
- Gardening (has many gardens)
- Lounging in the sun or moonlight
- Spending time with friends
- Relaxing with a Bloxy Cola

VIGILANTE:
Caesar believes that his natural gifts were that of fate, and that they are to 
be used as a tool to make the Bloxiverse a better place. Either alone, or 
alongside his allies Nauli and Vortex, he'll travel the Bloxiverse in search of 
villainy to apprehend, operating as a self-proclaimed vigilante. Whenever he 
subdues a criminal, he'll typically turn them in to the Hunter Association or 
another holding facility. Despite being offered a position and an extremely high 
rate of pay by these elite factions, Caesar refuses any and all offers. He acts 
out of heart and desire, not because he is being paid or praised for doing so, 
and taking a position at any faction would taint this mindset.


================================================================================
HISTORY
================================================================================

CREATION:
Caesar was born closer to one of Roblox's final waves of new Robloxians, cast 
into an already-crumbling society that was struggling to fully adjust to the new 
race. Caesar fled any and all conflict initially, eventually finding himself in 
the Outer Ring where he would soon go on to create a World. He imagined an 
island, floating atop an expanse of infinite sea, with a cycle of day and night 
like he had seen in other Worlds. From this vision, the World that would come to 
be known as "Caesar's Isle" was born.

Despite living in the Outer Ring, a notorious 'danger zone' for the Bloxiverse, 
Caesar lived a quiet and fulfilling life. Though, Caesar found it to be rather 
empty at times, for he had made no friends or family on his path. Despite this, 
Caesar always felt gratefulness, knowing that his situation in life always 
could've been far, far worse.

AWAKENING:
Some time after Caesar had established his World in the Outer Ring, a notorious 
faction known as the Exploiters began to appear, making waves on the news as a 
dangerous and fear-mongering faction that had no issues pillaging and usurping 
control of other Worlds for their own nefarious plans. Caesar thought little of 
it initially, until a fateful day where he too would be assaulted by a small 
squad of scouting Exploiters.

They attacked suddenly, without warning or restraint. Caesar did his best to 
resist, but his efforts were futile. He had strength, but that wouldn't be enough 
to best people who could fly, teleport, and do all kinds of harmful things that 
Caesar could barely wrap his head around at the time. They beat him senselessly, 
tarnishing his island and destroying his home in their efforts to look for 
valuables.

Caesar fully believed he'd die that day, as the ground cracked from being 
pummeled into it. But inside, on the brink of life and death, something latent 
awoke within Caesar. An electric static, deep within his soul—as though 
commanding him to stand and fight. A second wind allowed Caesar to arise, and he 
unleashed the Electrogravitic Flow for the first time. In his hazy and senseless 
state, he can only partially recall the events that transpired after that moment. 
Even so, Caesar is certain of at least one thing—the group of Exploiters who 
attacked him did not survive.

After recovering from the assault and resting in his now-dilapidated cabin, 
Caesar reflected on what had occurred during the attack. He realized how lucky he 
was to have survived, and that a likely-countless amount of other victims would 
not. A new and burning desire lit up in Caesar's mind, and it was decided. Caesar 
would dedicate himself to the training of his body and powers, to become a sworn 
defender and vigilante for those who could not defend themselves.

VIGILANTE:
Following the attack and Caesar's subsequent awakening, he would begin rigorous 
training to hone his powers and body for combat. It took effort and time to figure 
out how exactly the Flow functioned, but eventually Caesar had developed a 
basic grasp of its skillset. He took note of the strain it put on his body, and 
developed a technique that primarily relies on his physical strength instead of 
his powers alone.

After gaining confidence, he finally set out into the Bloxiverse for the first 
time, beginning his hunt for criminals up to no good. Most opponents fell with 
little effort, as Caesar came to realize just how powerful he really was. Some 
took effort, sure, but most would fall eventually. At times, the power would get 
to Caesar's head, and he'd reflect and wonder if such strength is what led so many 
others down the dark paths they led.


================================================================================
RELATIONSHIPS
================================================================================

NAULI PARTER - Close Friend & Ally:
Caesar and Nauli met a few years ago, during an unexpected encounter at a 
restaurant. Caesar spotted Nauli rummaging through the trash for scraps on his 
way inside the building, and decided to buy and bring her a proper meal.

This single act of kindness touched Nauli's heart, quickly breaking through her 
defensive walls as nobody had truly noticed or cared for her. For the first time 
in a long while, she felt safe enough to open up and the two began to chat over 
their meals. Their interests in one another only grew as they came to realize 
their shared values and goals, wishing for peace in the Bloxiverse.

From then on, the pair worked together in almost all aspects, with Caesar relying 
on Nauli's strategizing and Nauli relying on Caesar's brute strength to take down 
stronger opponents through their combined efforts. Nauli also began to spend time 
on Caesar's Isle, breathing a sigh of relief at a place to relax and call home.

VORTEX A STEELE - Former Enemy, Close Friend & Ally:
Initially, Vortex was contracted by the Hunter Association to eliminate Caesar due 
to a hit placed on him by Bryck Manning. Vortex successfully hunted down Caesar, 
and the two engaged in combat.

Their fight was valiant and hard-fought, but both sides came to the realization 
that their powers and strengths cancel out one another, and the two mutually 
agreed to stop fighting. With a moment to chat and actually relax, the two 
expressed their ideals and morals, quickly learning that they're rather alike.

Though skeptical and uncertain, both placed trust in one another and agreed to 
peace and cooperation. Vortex cancelled his contract, though this was not the end 
of his interactions with Caesar—quite the opposite. Caesar met Vortex on occasion 
from then on out, teaming up to handle tougher contracts that demanded more 
firepower than what he and his friend Nauli could provide alone.

The three have worked multiple times as an efficient and balanced trio, backed 
equally by strength, smarts, and speed.

RICE FARMER - Close Friend:
Rice was among one of the many victims Caesar had saved from being terrorized, 
particularly during an attack from Bryck on the Farmer Sanctuary, a peaceful 
World where a family of farmers grow tons of food for themselves and Bloxians in 
need.

Caesar and Rice continued to chat long after Caesar had already saved him, and 
the two have spent many days together since. Caesar was introduced to the ways of 
agriculture through Rice, which later led to Caesar's inspiration for starting his 
many gardens.

Rice has been a great source of comfort and calm for Caesar, as Rice is very 
down-to-earth and easy to be around.

BRYCK MANNING - Defeated Enemy:
Caesar and Nauli ventured out to the Farmer Sanctuary after seeing its ongoing 
attack on the news, at the hands of Bryck Manning.

The two arrived, and with some effort successfully subdued Bryck and removed his 
source of power, the Gravity Coil. Afterwards, the Gravity Coil was handed off to 
Ren Bytera for examination while Bryck was sent to the Hunter Association for 
processing and eventual imprisonment.

Bryck has held a grudge and strong vengeance for Caesar, unbeknownst to him.


================================================================================
COMBAT STYLE
================================================================================

Caesar's overwhelming size and bulwark build grant him incredible physical 
strength and durability, qualities which are only enhanced further by his 
ability. Caesar relies on slow, yet sturdy and incredibly lethal blows to quickly 
dispatch enemies that get caught in his path. Caesar is a juggernaut, backed by 
power that is not to be taken lightly.

Though Caesar has incredible physical potential, he lacks immensely in speed and 
reflexes. Opponents with proper agility and dexterity will have almost no issues 
avoiding Caesar and his slow-moving attacks, unless he is able to accurately 
predict or trick a target into attacking to counter them. The physical 'weight' 
added by his ability only draws back the speed of his movement further, as he 
exchanges mobility for lethality.

================================================================================
ABILITY: THE ELECTROGRAVITIC FLOW
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
Caesar's body acts as a perfect host and conduit for an anomalous source of 
power, formally known as the Electrogravitic Flow or 'The Flow' for short. The 
Flow manifests as a sharp, contorting plasma that ripples in blue across his 
entire body.

Through the Flow, Caesar can generate and discharge electrified plasma towards 
targets or his surroundings, allowing him to heavily damage targets or 
manipulate any local magnetic and gravitational forces his energy surrounds. This 
ability has a wide variety of applications in almost all aspects, making Caesar a 
versatile fighter who can tolerate combat in almost any environments while 
remaining both formidable and dangerous.

Despite the strengths the Flow offers, Caesar has yet to properly master the 
Flow or unlock any of its real potential, limiting his capabilities.

PASSIVE TECHNIQUES:

1. GENERATIVE GRAVITY:
The Flow can manipulate the flow of magnetism and gravity on areas or objects it 
comes into contact with, and this extends to Caesar's own body. This prevents him 
from being affected by gravitational anomalies, such as Black Holes or other 
abilities that affect the forces of gravity.

2. LIVING, LEAKING BATTERY:
Caesar's body acts essentially as both a generator and battery for the Flow, as 
it gets passively replenished as Caesar rests or eats food. Occasionally, the 
build-up of power within Caesar's body becomes overwhelming, causing him to 
forcibly eject extra energy if he doesn't frequently make use of his ability.

While this is manageable if Caesar consistently fights or remembers to discharge 
his extra energy, forgetting often means extensive property damage and injuries to 
anyone in his immediate surroundings.

3. OVERDRIVE:
When Caesar is in a life-threatening situation or his adrenaline is pumping, the 
Flow goes into overdrive and begins mass-producing additional energy. This allows 
Caesar to push his limits and keep fighting even while exhausted.

However, abusing these limits can cause Caesar to grow ill and become susceptible 
to going berserk from the Flow's influence until he eventually collapses from 
exhaustion.

OFFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:

1. DISCHARGE:
Charging the Flow into his hands, Caesar can discharge energy into his 
surroundings or towards targets, shocking them and making them susceptible to 
Caesar's gravity manipulation. This enables him to use a form of telekinesis, 
freely throwing his opponents or slowing them down greatly if they lack the 
physical strength to overpower the effects.

Heavier targets require Caesar to discharge larger quantities of energy, making 
them harder to manipulate and using more of Caesar's stamina and Flow reserves.

2. ELECTROPULSE:
Caesar can channel the Flow across his entire body, and discharge a wave of energy 
into his surroundings, shocking them and allowing him to gain control over the 
flow of gravity and magnetism in his immediate surroundings temporarily.

Gaining control over gravity through this method is far less refined than 
discharging onto specific targets, though it is highly effective if Caesar is 
facing multiple opponents.

3. SELF-AMPLIFICATION:
Caesar can freely manipulate his own weight due to his generative gravity, 
allowing him to amplify the weight of his limbs or entire body. By channeling the 
Flow with specific timings in tandem with his own movements, Caesar can seriously 
increase the power behind his physical attacks. With enough momentum, Caesar can 
successfully breach thick walls, and rip armored doors from their hinges.

Caesar needs to remain mindful of how much he amplifies his body, as his body may 
not be able to adjust properly if he increases his weight too much, causing him to 
collapse under the pressure.

DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:

1. HARD-LIGHT ARMOR:
Caesar can generate and compress his energy into solid, "hard-light" armor that 
affixes to his body and protects him from both blunt-force trauma and 
electricity. Depending on how much energy was poured into the barrier, hard-light 
armor can protect Caesar anywhere from weaker firearms, all the way to small 
explosions before cracking or shattering from the damage.

Maintaining hard-light armor is incredibly draining of Caesar's energy and can 
quickly exhaust him if his defenses are shattered multiple times in a row in 
quick succession. Additionally, hard-light armor can be incredibly heavy, 
reducing Caesar's speed even further.

2. HARD-LIGHT BARRIERS:
Similarly to how Caesar can generate hard-light armor, he can also generate 
constructs formed of this energy to project protective barriers or shielding to 
defend allies from an attack. This shielding has the same properties as Caesar's 
hard-light armor, defending targets from damage up to small explosives and 
electricity.

Caesar cannot generate hard-light armor if he is currently projecting his energy 
into shielding for another target, as his focus must remain on the shield due to 
it not being connected to his body, unlike hard-light armor.

UTILITARIAN TECHNIQUES:

1. PSEUDO-TELEKINESIS:
When objects or areas are imbued with Caesar's energy, he can freely channel the 
gravity and magnetism of them, allowing him to toss targets around or weigh them 
down drastically. It can also be utilized for simple tasks in his daily life, 
fetching items from far away or allowing him to hold things without needing to 
use his hand.

Naturally, the more objects he manipulates, the higher the energy requirement 
becomes. While it's relatively easy to hold a large quantity of small objects, 
particularly heavy objects can quickly push his limits if held for long periods of 
time.

DRAWBACKS:

1. RAPID ENERGY CONSUMPTION:
A majority of the Flow's abilities require serious amounts of Caesar's stamina to 
remain effective, and overuse can quickly put him out of commission if he isn't 
careful.

2. WEIGHED DOWN:
The Flow carries an extremely heavy weight that Caesar must endure to effectively 
use the Flow, and it only worsens as Caesar attempts larger-scaled attacks or 
attacks of a higher potency. Techniques such as the hard-light armor are 
especially taxing on Caesar's body, often slowing his speeds to a crawl, and 
rarely immobilizing him entirely.

3. MENTAL CORRUPTION:
If Caesar becomes too lost in combat or pushes his ability far beyond safe 
limits, he can become susceptible to mental corruption, leading to Caesar going 
berserk. In this state, Caesar becomes incredibly dangerous to remain around, 
regardless of if you are a friend or foe.

Though Caesar's mentality remains intact-enough to differentiate between an ally 
and an enemy, his attacks and the Flow's effects are greatly amplified and pose a 
serious risk for any Bloxians in his immediate surroundings, including Caesar 
himself.

This rampage tends to last until Caesar is calmed down, incapacitated, or becomes 
exhausted. Afterwards, Caesar becomes greatly limited in terms of strength, and 
the Flow often goes completely offline to recover from Caesar's abuse.
