                    PART I: THE BLOXIVERSE - OVERVIEW & COSMOLOGY
================================================================================

The Bloxiverse is a coined term referring to a collective of Robloxian Worlds 
and celestial bodies, which have been interconnected through cosmic strings that 
weave the very fabric of reality and hold them together. It stretches out 
seemingly-infinite distances from the center, where a mass of pure energy known 
as the Heart resides. Beyond the interiors of Worlds and other important 
landmarks, the Bloxiverse is devoid of any tangible matter such as air.

The Bloxiverse is primarily inhabited by Bloxians and the various Bloxian 
subspecies, who've spread far and wide across its reaches throughout history. 
Life within the Bloxiverse is chaotic and unruly, as no major forces of power 
exist (or are strong/widespread enough) to govern it or maintain order. As a 
result, many Bloxians have banded together to create smaller-scale civilizations 
or factions across one or multiple worlds, in an attempt to create a sense of 
order or law within such a nomadic reality.

The creator of the Bloxiverse was a deity known as Roblox, who has long since 
disappeared since the inception of the Bloxiverse. His fate is undetermined, but 
many believe him to be deceased or otherwise imprisoned in some way.

The Bloxiverse's total size equals roughly the size of an actual Roblox 
experience, or approximately 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 
studs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        THE SEGMENTS OF THE BLOXIVERSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE MIASMA
----------
The Miasma is a cosmic slurry that occupies the space between worlds, made up of 
celestial residue such as stardust and antimatter. It is present within every 
major segment of the Bloxiverse, existing everywhere that matter (such as air) 
does not. It has no texture and cannot be "felt" by one's touch, nor moved 
through any standard methods.

The Miasma is primordially tied to Bloxians, and reacts to their presence. Those 
that enter the Miasma can freely move themselves within it, attaining a form of 
flight so long as they are surrounded by it. They can breathe normally as though 
surrounded by oxygen, despite no need to inhale or exhale.

The speeds at which they can travel depends on their fitness, equipment, and any 
abilities they may have. Some have even gone on to craft inter-world vessels, 
capable of travelling across entire segments in minutes.

THE HEART
---------
At the absolute center of the Bloxiverse (coordinates 0,0,0) resides the Heart, 
a celestial mass created by Roblox to fuel the Bloxiverse for an eternity—even 
in his own absence. It radiates a pure white light, illuminating the farthest 
reaches of the Bloxiverse for all to see. Reality itself revolves around the 
Heart, depending on it for survival.

The Heart's influence stretches extremely far, as it is interconnected with each 
Bloxian and every Robloxian World that exists (or will come to exist). The 
matter produced and released by the Heart is pure and raw potential in a 
physical and tangible form. When a new Robloxian World or Bloxian is made, 
fractions of potential is pulled from the Heart and "collapses" into a final 
possibility—which is how Bloxians and Robloxian Worlds are made from nothing but 
dreams and visions.

The Heart is integral for the Bloxiverse to function and exist, as the Heart is 
everything just as everything is the Heart. Without its boundless power to keep 
expanding and maintaining the Bloxiverse, reality would inevitably collapse into 
itself. Tampering with the Heart in any form is an incredibly dangerous game, as 
most matter that comes into contact with raw potential is, itself, assimilated 
into the Heart's potential.

THE INNER CIRCLE
----------------
The Inner Circle is the closest segment of the Bloxiverse towards the Heart. It 
is home to the strongest and/or largest civilizations and factions (such as the 
Hunter Association), who govern over the Inner Circle (as it is the smallest 
segment and the easiest to manage).

As the Inner Circle is heavily fortified and enforced by law, crime rarely 
occurs and most civilians live a peaceful and secure lifestyle. Unfortunately, 
as the Inner Circle is the smallest zone of the Bloxiverse, it is unable to 
house large amounts of Bloxians and Robloxian Worlds. The limited space has led 
to it be considered as an elite and heavily-gatekept spot to live, with access 
granted only to significant Bloxians or groups.

THE MIDZONE
-----------
The Midzone is a segment of the Bloxiverse that begins just beyond the Inner 
Circle. It is heavily populated, being the next-best choice beyond the 
prestigious Inner Circle.

Though it isn't well-governed or remotely as secure as the Inner Circle, many 
have chosen to live within the Midzone due to its close proximity to the Heart 
and the major factions that reside around it. Many tightly-knit communities 
exist within the Midzone, working together to prosper and ward off criminals and 
the ill-intentioned.

The Midzone's population is very unevenly distributed, with most living as close 
as they can to the border between the Midzone and the Inner Circle. The further 
one travels away from the border between the two, the more scarce worlds start 
to become and the more risk you put yourself in.

THE OUTER CIRCLE
----------------
The Outer Circle is a segment which marks a turning point between civilization 
and anarchy. It is mostly barren and empty, with occasional (and often-
abandoned) Worlds to be found. The light of the Heart slowly begins to dim at 
distances such as these, giving a darker appearance and atmosphere to the Outer 
Circle. Danger only rises as one continues to venture farther from the Inner 
Circle.

Due to the lack of any major factions, civilizations or consequences for their 
crimes, many criminals reside within the Outer Circle and beyond. They often 
seek out helpless victims who stray too far from the Midzone, either to murder, 
rob, or otherwise bring some form of harm upon them. They are outcasts of 
society or simply do not wish to partake in it, preferring to act only for their 
own benefit and pleasure—even to the detriment of others. Some Bloxians are even 
banished to the Outer Circle, typically if they were punished for particularly 
severe crimes.

THE BANLANDS
------------
The Banlands is a segment incredibly far beyond the Outer Circle, a wasteland 
filled to the brim with dangers around every corner. Worlds are incredibly rare, 
and those that exist often house abhorrent criminals who were exiled to the 
farthest reaches and repent, suffering alone. The Heart's light barely reaches 
such lengthy distances, painting everything inside in a dark crimson hue.

The Banlands are unrecognizably disturbing and twisted, especially when compared 
to populated areas such as the Inner Circle. A red hue fills the Miasma, as far 
as the eye can see. Though the Banlands are mostly empty, those that do reside 
within are incredibly dangerous and often seek only destruction and misery. 
Factions and society as a whole cannot survive in hostile conditions such as 
these, and most Bloxians who enter the radius of the Banlands never return.

THE VOID
--------
Travelling far beyond the Banlands, one will find themselves within the Void. It 
is a desolate, black space that lacks any tangible matter beyond the Miasma. The 
connection between reality and the Heart runs thin at these distances, and its 
light cannot stretch this far. This leaves anyone who enters in a pitch-black 
darkness, with the shine of the distant Heart behind them.

Travel becomes increasingly difficult with the emergence of new problems, as it 
can become incredibly easy to get lost within the darkness. Worlds cannot be 
created this far out, meaning that abandoned Worlds to seek shelter in or loot 
for supplies do not exist. Bloxians grow tired quicker as their connection to 
the Heart thins, requiring more food and sleep to sustain themselves.

THE NULL BOUNDARY
-----------------
Venturing deeper into the Void, mysterious symptoms will begin to manifest and 
intensify as one travels farther on. This means that a Bloxian is reaching the 
point of no return.

At first, these symptoms are negligible and may even go unnoticed by many. 
Bloxians may struggle with their movement, as their bodies almost appear to 
"jitter" in place. They'll start to feel lightheaded and nauseous, struggling 
further with their sense of direction. As time goes on, these effects 
exponentially intensify. The jittering of matter starts to rip flesh and tear 
materials apart, as the minds of Bloxians begin to rupture both physically and 
mentally. It is a feeling of indescribable agony, as though a million hands are 
pulling on you in a million different directions.

If somehow a Bloxian is able to tolerate or otherwise negate these effects, they 
will eventually arrive at a barrier known as the Null Boundary. It appears as 
though it is made of glass, and jitters similarly to matter that ventures this 
far out. Despite being classified as a "barrier", it is more of a one-way door. 
Matter that makes contact with it is immediately pulled in.

Do not make contact with the Null Boundary. DO NOT make contact with the Null 
Boundary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              THE EDGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Edge is a dimensional plane that exists beyond the fabrics of the Bloxiverse 
itself. It is an ethereal limbo created by Roblox, serving as the realm where 
souls of the deceased are processed and put to rest. It is entirely 
monochromatic, existing in shades of grey and white.

The Edge is the domain of Spawnboy, the primordial deity created by Roblox to 
handle the forces of life and death. Only Spawnboy and the souls of deceased 
Bloxians can exist within the Edge—no living being can enter this realm.

================================================================================
                       PART II: THE BLOXIAN RACES
================================================================================

There are three primary races of Bloxians that inhabit the Bloxiverse, each with 
their own origins and capabilities.

GUESTS (Extinct)
----------------
The Guests were the first sentient race created by Roblox, serving as the 
original inhabitants of the Bloxiverse. They eventually turned against Roblox 
and were subsequently exterminated. Very little is known about them in the 
modern era.

NOOBS
-----
Noobs were the second race created by Roblox, designed to be more docile and 
obedient than the Guests that preceded them. They are typically characterized by 
their simpler appearances and yellow skin tones. Noobs cannot create Robloxian 
Worlds of their own—a capability exclusive to Robloxians (with the sole 
exception of Builderman, who was granted this power by Roblox directly).

Notable Noobs include:
- Builderman (Divine powers from Roblox)
- Vortex A. Steele (Chronipulation ability)
- Ren Bytera (Scientific genius)

ROBLOXIANS
----------
Robloxians were the third and final race created by Roblox before his 
disappearance. They are more varied in appearance than Noobs and possess the 
innate ability to create Robloxian Worlds through their imagination. Robloxians 
were born during multiple "waves" of creation, with later waves occurring closer 
to Roblox's disappearance.

Notable Robloxians include:
- Caesar Bloxwright (Electrogravitic Flow ability)
- Nauli Parter (Pathokinesis—augmented)
- Charles Studson (Chainipulation ability)
- Bryck Manning (Uses Gravity Coil)
- Rice Farmer (Civilian, no powers)
- Bloxxanne Whelder (Engineer, no powers)

================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          CAESAR BLOXWRIGHT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 24
Alignment: Chaotic/Good
Role: Chaperone
Ability: The Electrogravitic Flow

OVERVIEW:
Caesar Bloxwright is an extremely tall and widely-built Robloxian who serves as 
a self-proclaimed vigilante, dedicated to ridding the Bloxiverse of evil. He is 
a towering giant with an equally-sized heart, deeply valuing his family and 
friends while adopting a protective nature toward those he has grown close to.

APPEARANCE:
Caesar is dressed in a black, white-collared trench coat with a grey bowtie 
clipped at his neck. He has long sleeves which slit into fingerless gloves at 
their ends. He has messily-parted, jet black hair with portions poking out and 
sticking up. Despite having no bangs or obstructions covering his eyes beyond 
circular glasses, a shadow always appears to hide them from view, even if a 
light source is directly shined in his face.

PERSONALITY:
Caesar is a walking definition of both empathy and resolve. He is a loyal 
protector whose heart is as strong as his fists, carrying a deep-rooted sense of 
love and loyalty for those he values. He is very down-to-earth and quick-witted, 
usually capable of remaining calm under decent amounts of pressure.

However, as Caesar pushes the limits of both his body and abilities, the strain 
and sheer power causes him to lose his composure, as sanity slips away from his 
mind. In desperate situations, Caesar has a tendency to enter a berserk-like 
state, drastically altering his behavior and personality into bloodlust, blind 
rage, and sadism.

ABILITY - THE ELECTROGRAVITIC FLOW:
Caesar's body acts as a perfect host and conduit for an anomalous source of 
power, formally known as the Electrogravitic Flow or 'The Flow' for short. The 
Flow manifests as a sharp, contorting plasma that ripples in blue across his 
entire body.

Through the Flow, Caesar can generate and discharge electrified plasma towards 
targets or his surroundings, allowing him to heavily damage targets or 
manipulate any local magnetic and gravitational forces his energy surrounds. 
This ability has a wide variety of applications in almost all aspects, making 
Caesar a versatile fighter who can tolerate combat in almost any environments 
while remaining both formidable and dangerous.

Despite the strengths the Flow offers, Caesar has yet to properly master the 
Flow or unlock any of its real potential, limiting his capabilities.

PASSIVE ABILITIES:
- Generative Gravity: The Flow can manipulate the flow of magnetism and gravity 
  on areas or objects it comes into contact with, and this extends to Caesar's 
  own body. This prevents him from being affected by gravitational anomalies, 
  such as Black Holes or other abilities that affect the forces of gravity.
- Living, Leaking Battery: Caesar's body acts essentially as both a generator and 
  battery for the Flow, as it gets passively replenished as Caesar rests or eats 
  food. Occasionally, the build-up of power within Caesar's body becomes 
  overwhelming, causing him to forcibly eject extra energy if he doesn't 
  frequently make use of his ability. While this is manageable if Caesar 
  consistently fights or remembers to discharge his extra energy, forgetting 
  often means extensive property damage and injuries to anyone in his immediate 
  surroundings.
- Overdrive: When Caesar is in a life-threatening situation or his adrenaline 
  is pumping, the Flow goes into overdrive and begins mass-producing additional 
  energy. This allows Caesar to push his limits and keep fighting even while 
  exhausted. However, abusing these limits can cause Caesar to grow ill and 
  become susceptible to going berserk from the Flow's influence until he 
  eventually collapses from exhaustion.

OFFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Discharge: Charging the Flow into his hands, Caesar can discharge energy into 
  his surroundings or towards targets, shocking them and making them susceptible 
  to Caesar's gravity manipulation. This enables him to use a form of telekinesis, 
  freely throwing his opponents or slowing them down greatly if they lack the 
  physical strength to overpower the effects. Heavier targets require Caesar to 
  discharge larger quantities of energy, making them harder to manipulate and 
  using more of Caesar's stamina and Flow reserves.
- Electropulse: Caesar can channel the Flow across his entire body, and discharge 
  a wave of energy into his surroundings, shocking them and allowing him to gain 
  control over the flow of gravity and magnetism in his immediate surroundings 
  temporarily. Gaining control over gravity through this method is far less 
  refined than discharging onto specific targets, though it is highly effective 
  if Caesar is facing multiple opponents.
- Self-Amplification: Caesar can freely manipulate his own weight due to his 
  generative gravity, allowing him to amplify the weight of his limbs or entire 
  body. By channeling the Flow with specific timings in tandem with his own 
  movements, Caesar can seriously increase the power behind his physical attacks. 
  With enough momentum, Caesar can successfully breach thick walls, and rip 
  armored doors from their hinges. Caesar needs to remain mindful of how much he 
  amplifies his body, as his body may not be able to adjust properly if he 
  increases his weight too much, causing him to collapse under the pressure.

DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Hard-Light Armor: Caesar can generate and compress his energy into solid, 
  "hard-light" armor that affixes to his body and protects him from both 
  blunt-force trauma and electricity. Depending on how much energy was poured 
  into the barrier, hard-light armor can protect Caesar anywhere from weaker 
  firearms, all the way to small explosions before cracking or shattering from 
  the damage. Maintaining hard-light armor is incredibly draining of Caesar's 
  energy and can quickly exhaust him if his defenses are shattered multiple times 
  in a row in quick succession. Additionally, hard-light armor can be incredibly 
  heavy, reducing Caesar's speed even further.
- Hard-Light Barriers: Similarly to how Caesar can generate hard-light armor, he 
  can also generate constructs formed of this energy to project protective 
  barriers or shielding to defend allies from an attack. This shielding has the 
  same properties as Caesar's hard-light armor, defending targets from damage up 
  to small explosives and electricity. Caesar cannot generate hard-light armor if 
  he is currently projecting his energy into shielding for another target, as his 
  focus must remain on the shield due to it not being connected to his body, 
  unlike hard-light armor.

UTILITARIAN TECHNIQUES:
- Pseudo-Telekinesis: When objects or areas are imbued with Caesar's energy, he 
  can freely channel the gravity and magnetism of them, allowing him to toss 
  targets around or weigh them down drastically. It can also be utilized for 
  simple tasks in his daily life, fetching items from far away or allowing him 
  to hold things without needing to use his hand. Naturally, the more objects 
  he manipulates, the higher the energy requirement becomes. While it's 
  relatively easy to hold a large quantity of small objects, particularly heavy 
  objects can quickly push his limits if held for long periods of time.

DRAWBACKS:
- Rapid Energy Consumption: A majority of the Flow's abilities require serious 
  amounts of Caesar's stamina to remain effective, and overuse can quickly put 
  him out of commission if he isn't careful.
- Weighed Down: The Flow carries an extremely heavy weight that Caesar must 
  endure to effectively use the Flow, and it only worsens as Caesar attempts 
  larger-scaled attacks or attacks of a higher potency. Techniques such as the 
  hard-light armor are especially taxing on Caesar's body, often slowing his 
  speeds to a crawl, and rarely immobilizing him entirely.
- Mental Corruption: If Caesar becomes too lost in combat or pushes his ability 
  far beyond safe limits, he can become susceptible to mental corruption, leading 
  to Caesar going berserk. In this state, Caesar becomes incredibly dangerous to 
  remain around, regardless of if you are a friend or foe. Though Caesar's 
  mentality remains intact-enough to differentiate between an ally and an enemy, 
  his attacks and the Flow's effects are greatly amplified and pose a serious risk 
  for any Bloxians in his immediate surroundings, including Caesar himself. This 
  rampage tends to last until Caesar is calmed down, incapacitated, or becomes 
  exhausted. Afterwards, Caesar becomes greatly limited in terms of strength, and 
  the Flow often goes completely offline to recover from Caesar's abuse.

HISTORY:

Creation:
Caesar was born closer to one of Roblox's final waves of new Robloxians, cast 
into an already-crumbling society that was struggling to fully adjust to the 
new race. Caesar fled any and all conflict initially, eventually finding himself 
in the Outer Ring where he would soon go on to create a World. He imagined an 
island, floating atop an expanse of infinite sea, with a cycle of day and night 
like he had seen in other Worlds. From this vision, the World that would come 
to be known as "Caesar's Isle" was born.

Despite living in the Outer Ring, a notorious 'danger zone' for the Bloxiverse, 
Caesar lived a quiet and fulfilling life. Though, Caesar found it to be rather 
empty at times, for he had made no friends or family on his path. Despite this, 
Caesar always felt gratefulness, knowing that his situation in life always 
could've been far, far worse.

Awakening:
Some time after Caesar had established his World in the Outer Ring, a notorious 
faction known as the Exploiters began to appear, making waves on the news as a 
dangerous and fear-mongering faction that had no issues pillaging and usurping 
control of other Worlds for their own nefarious plans. Caesar thought little of 
it initially, until a fateful day where he too would be assaulted by a small 
squad of scouting Exploiters.

They attacked suddenly, without warning or restraint. Caesar did his best to 
resist, but his efforts were futile. He had strength, but that wouldn't be enough 
to best people who could fly, teleport, and do all kinds of harmful things that 
Caesar could barely wrap his head around at the time. They beat him senselessly, 
tarnishing his island and destroying his home in their efforts to look for 
valuables.

Caesar fully believed he'd die that day, as the ground cracked from being 
pummeled into it. But inside, on the brink of life and death, something latent 
awoke within Caesar. An electric static, deep within his soul—as though 
commanding him to stand and fight. A second wind allowed Caesar to arise, and 
he unleashed the Electrogravitic Flow for the first time. In his hazy and 
senseless state, he can only partially recall the events that transpired after 
that moment. Even so, Caesar is certain of at least one thing—the group of 
Exploiters who attacked him did not survive.

After recovering from the assault and resting in his now-dilapidated cabin, 
Caesar reflected on what had occurred during the attack. He realized how lucky 
he was to have survived, and that a likely-countless amount of other victims 
would not. A new and burning desire lit up in Caesar's mind, and it was 
decided. Caesar would dedicate himself to the training of his body and powers, 
to become a sworn defender and vigilante for those who could not defend 
themselves.

Vigilante:
Following the attack and Caesar's subsequent awakening, he would begin rigorous 
training to hone his powers and body for combat. It took effort and time to 
figure out how exactly the Flow functioned, but eventually Caesar had developed 
a basic grasp of its skillset. He took note of the strain it put on his body, 
and developed a technique that primarily relies on his physical strength instead 
of his powers alone.

After gaining confidence, he finally set out into the Bloxiverse for the first 
time, beginning his hunt for criminals up to no good. Most opponents fell with 
little effort, as Caesar came to realize just how powerful he really was. Some 
took effort, sure, but most would fall eventually. At times, the power would get 
to Caesar's head, and he'd reflect and wonder if such strength is what led so 
many others down the dark paths they led.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:

Nauli Parter - Close Friend & Ally:
Caesar and Nauli met a few years ago, during an unexpected encounter at a 
restaurant. Caesar spotted Nauli rummaging through the trash for scraps on his 
way inside the building, and decided to buy and bring her a proper meal. This 
single act of kindness touched Nauli's heart, quickly breaking through her 
defensive walls as nobody had truly noticed or cared for her. For the first time 
in a long while, she felt safe enough to open up and the two began to chat over 
their meals. Their interests in one another only grew as they came to realize 
their shared values and goals, wishing for peace in the Bloxiverse. From then on, 
the pair worked together in almost all aspects, with Caesar relying on Nauli's 
strategizing and Nauli relying on Caesar's brute strength to take down stronger 
opponents through their combined efforts. Nauli also began to spend time on 
Caesar's Isle, breathing a sigh of relief at a place to relax and call home.

Vortex A. Steele - Former Enemy, Close Friend & Ally:
Initially, Vortex was contracted by the Hunter Association to eliminate Caesar 
due to a hit placed on him by Bryck Manning. Vortex successfully hunted down 
Caesar, and the two engaged in combat. Their fight was valiant and hard-fought, 
but both sides came to the realization that their powers and strengths cancel 
out one another, and the two mutually agreed to stop fighting. With a moment to 
chat and actually relax, the two expressed their ideals and morals, quickly 
learning that they're rather alike. Though skeptical and uncertain, both placed 
trust in one another and agreed to peace and cooperation. Vortex cancelled his 
contract, though this was not the end of his interactions with Caesar—quite the 
opposite. Caesar met Vortex on occasion from then on out, teaming up to handle 
tougher contracts that demanded more firepower than what he and his friend Nauli 
could provide alone. The three have worked multiple times as an efficient and 
balanced trio, backed equally by strength, smarts, and speed.

Rice Farmer - Close Friend:
Rice was among one of the many victims Caesar had saved from being terrorized, 
particularly during an attack from Bryck on the Farmer Sanctuary, a peaceful 
World where a family of farmers grow tons of food for themselves and Bloxians in 
need. Caesar and Rice continued to chat long after Caesar had already saved him, 
and the two have spent many days together since. Caesar was introduced to the 
ways of agriculture through Rice, which later led to Caesar's inspiration for 
starting his many gardens. Rice has been a great source of comfort and calm for 
Caesar, as Rice is very down-to-earth and easy to be around.

Bryck Manning - Defeated Enemy:
Caesar and Nauli ventured out to the Farmer Sanctuary after seeing its ongoing 
attack on the news, at the hands of Bryck Manning. The two arrived, and with 
some effort successfully subdued Bryck and removed his source of power, the 
Gravity Coil. Afterwards, the Gravity Coil was handed off to Ren Bytera for 
examination while Bryck was sent to the Hunter Association for processing and 
eventual imprisonment. Bryck has held a grudge and strong vengeance for Caesar, 
unbeknownst to him.

COMBAT STYLE:
Caesar's overwhelming size and bulwark build grant him incredible physical 
strength and durability, making him a slow but hard-hitting tank. His attacks 
carry impressive power that can prove lethal for fragile or unexpecting 
opponents. However, he struggles greatly against quicker targets due to his lack 
of speed and reflexes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            NAULI PARTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 23
Alignment: Rebel/Moral
Role: Protestor
Ability: Pathokinesis (Augmented)

OVERVIEW:
Nauli Parter is a nomadic Robloxian with augmented psychic abilities, traveling 
the Bloxiverse to serve justice alongside her close allies. She operates as both 
an assassin and strategist, known for her split personality that makes her both 
a strong ally and a dangerous enemy.

APPEARANCE:
Nauli is an average-built Robloxian, often seen wearing a grey, white-striped 
tracksuit. She is equipped with a variety of green armaments, including a 
utility belt, scarf, and a shoulder pad. Affixed to the left of her belt is a 
combat knife. She has blonde, bobbed hair with two metal antennae protruding 
from either side of her head—these are the psy-link antennae implanted during 
her augmentation.

PERSONALITY:
Nauli has a distinct split personality:

With Strangers: Cold, cynical, and merciless. She won't hesitate to attack and 
eliminate those she believes to be a threat. She finds no use in pulling her 
punches or flaring her style, believing it is better to be effective than fancy.

With Friends/Family: Cheery, friendly, and energetic. She loves to encourage and 
help those she loves. She likes to remain productive, helping with small chores 
around the homes of her allies even if she isn't asked.

ABILITY - PATHOKINESIS:
Nauli's psy-link antennae grant her the ability of Pathokinesis, allowing her 
to influence and manipulate the psyche of her victims. This mental manipulation 
has a handful of useful applications, and can prove to be either beneficial or 
detrimental depending on who she is influencing and the effort she is putting in 
to her manipulation. Though Nauli has had ample time to refine her techniques 
and ability, it appears as though some untapped potential remains.

PASSIVE ABILITIES:
- Mind Reading: Nauli can tune in to the thoughts and feelings of those nearby, 
  allowing her to quickly gather any information she wishes to know. This can be 
  incredibly useful when interrogating targets, as it is physically impossible 
  for them to lie. Interestingly, some form of mental block prevents her from 
  reading the minds of those she loves, preventing the effects from working on 
  Caesar, Vortex, etc.
- Subconscious Influence: Nauli's psy-link antennae constantly produce waves 
  that influence Bloxians on a subconscious level, subtly altering their 
  behaviors and thoughts to benefit Nauli. These effects are extremely weak and 
  only cause slight shifts in personalities or desires. Nauli doesn't do this 
  intentionally, so it would seem that the psy-link antennae are reading Nauli's 
  own subconscious automatically, and projecting her desires into the minds of 
  others.
- Influence Immunity: Due to the presence of psy-link antennae in Nauli's brain 
  and skull, she is naturally immune to the influence of other psychic powers, 
  particularly those that affect the emotional spectrum or memories.

OFFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Mental Depress: Nauli can depress the minds of her targets, severely reducing 
  their motivation and morale. Typically, this causes enemies to act aloof or 
  carelessly, making them easier targets to eliminate.
- Psyscramble: Essentially unleashing a mental EMP, Nauli can temporarily 
  scramble the thoughts and memories of her targets, heavily confusing them and 
  making them extremely vulnerable targets until they can regain composure.

DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Psy-clones: Projecting realistic illusory clones of herself into the mind of 
  her target, Nauli can become near-impossible to track as the victim is likely 
  to attack one of the many fake Naulis instead of the real one.

UTILITARIAN TECHNIQUES:
- Psych Up: Nauli can channel motivation and bravery into her allies, boosting 
  their morale and allowing them to fight with confidence, even in situations 
  that seem bleak or completely hopeless. Despite not offering any direct boost 
  in power to her allies, boosting them mentally has proven to be extremely 
  effective as the reduced pressure makes it easier to think smarter.
- Pain Tolerance: Nauli can numb the pain of her own injuries or the injuries of 
  another Bloxian by blocking the receptors in the brain that process pain. This 
  can completely ease the suffering of those who have been heavily injured, and 
  enables wounded Bloxians to continue fighting with their all. It's important to 
  note that while the pain can be completely numbed and ignored, no actual 
  healing occurs, making it the equivalent to a powerful painkiller.

DRAWBACKS:
- Enemy Resolve: Pathokinesis has reduced effectiveness against those with a 
  strong mind or resolve. It also struggles against those with no capacity to 
  feel emotion, or those who are mentally insane. In some severe cases, 
  Pathokinesis can be entirely nullified.

HISTORY:

Creation:
Nauli was created during one of the final Robloxian waves prior to Roblox's 
disappearance, thrown into the frenzy with little to no knowledge of life. Like 
many other Robloxians, she fled and sought refuge in a Robloxian world of her 
own creation, born from her imagination. She created a paradise, full of grassy 
valleys and rivers that ran as far as the eye could see, with clear sunny skies 
and a crisp, cool breeze you could soak in for hours. Nauli's world grew to be 
quite a popular settlement for Robloxians and Noobs alike, as it was positioned 
in the Inner Ring, a segment of the Bloxiverse highly accessible to most 
Bloxians, due to its proximity to the Heart. Slowly but surely, Nauli amassed a 
small village of Bloxians whom she grew close with and lived alongside in 
prosperity. Life was perfect for Nauli, and she has always recalled it as the 
happiest period of her life.

Scarlet:
Some time had passed since establishing her World, and the village inside had 
amassed into a small settlement by this point. She had formed countless 
relationships and meaningful connections throughout her experience in life, and 
she had been taught many practical skills by her villagers. She was revered as a 
wonderful leader and a beacon of hope for the Bloxiverse. But alas, nothing good 
can last forever. As her World was easily accessible, it was only a matter of 
time before those with impure intentions would stumble upon her domain. 
Eventually, this fate came to pass as the Scarlet Flame, a notorious criminal 
and pyromaniac, discovered the World and her settlement. From then on, the fate 
of the World and its inhabitants were sealed.

The superheated inferno and genocide that soon followed was nothing short of 
horrific. Entire portions of the settlement ignited into crimson-colored flames, 
as helpless innocents scrambled for safety, only to be burnt alive. The rivers 
boiled as the waters were stained red with blood, before turning black from the 
ash of corpses and structures alike. Explosions erupted, dealing with sturdier 
buildings formed of rock and other non-flammable materials. Nauli, shellshocked 
and barely holding a grip of herself, managed to barely escape her own World in 
time, before it collapsed from the extensive heat damage at the hands of the 
Scarlet Flame. In a mere hour, Nauli's entire life and all of her lifelong 
friends had been claimed by the crimson fires, leaving her with nothing but the 
charred clothes on her body and a traumatic experience. That day forever changed 
Nauli, and she was never quite the same again. She became untrusting, developing 
a cold and cynical outlook on life. She stopped caring, and grew bitter to the 
Bloxiverse. Despite it all, she vowed to never become a monster such as the 
Scarlet Flame.

Augmentation:
Piece by piece, Nauli managed to rebuild her life, though the trauma never 
truly left her. She trained and tried to grow from her experiences, becoming 
remarkably flexible and agile over time. Her prowess and skillset eventually 
gathered the attention of Ren, a morally-absent scientist who saw Nauli as a 
perfect experimentation opportunity. Ren introduced herself to Nauli, and pitched 
her plan to enhance Nauli's abilities. Though reluctant, Nauli believed she had 
little to lose and agreed to undergo the procedure. She would have psy-link 
antennae directly implanted into her skull and brain, with the promise of a large 
pay and Nauli's absolute safety.

The surgery was a success, though it yielded unexpected results. The experiment 
was originally intended to grant Nauli psychic abilities, allowing her to send 
messages to the minds of other Bloxians, and mentally tune into the radio. 
While this worked as intended, Nauli could now also send out signals through her 
antennae, enabling her to manipulate the psyche of other Bloxians nearby. Ren was 
fascinated by this new ability, and insisted Nauli stay put for further 
testing. Eventually, Nauli was released back into the world, with her permanent 
antennae and new abilities. From here, she began to wonder what she could 
accomplish with a power such as hers. Time would soon tell.

Assassin:
Nauli eventually came to the conclusion that her best bet was to use her ability 
combatively, inspiring her to become a spy and assassin for-hire. It wasn't long 
before contracts began to roll in, and Nauli quickly picked up on the dirty 
work. She was efficient, and no intel remained out of reach through the use of 
her psychic powers. She found solace through these contracts, rediscovering her 
purpose that had long-since been extinguished by the Scarlet Flame. Nauli went 
on to hone her abilities and eventually became a master in her line of work. She 
trained and grew to become incredibly efficient with small weapons such as 
daggers and kunai, taking advantage of her speeds and flexibility to quickly 
outpace her contracts, and swiftly eliminate those she was told to. Her colder 
nature made her a natural, and her contracts were dropping like flies. She felt 
unstoppable, if not for the lingering thoughts of the Scarlet Flame in her 
mind. Some time after becoming an Assassin, she met Caesar and the two clicked 
almost immediately. Their shared morale and ideals made them realize it would be 
in their best interests to cooperate, leading the pair to collaborate in an 
effort to apprehend dangerous Bloxians that were too risky to tackle alone.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:

Caesar Bloxwright - Close Friend & Ally:
Nauli was rummaging through a garbage bin for scraps of food, as she was running 
low on cash. Suddenly, a gentleman approached her, offering up a packaged meal he 
had purchased specifically for her from the till. Though Nauli's skepticism and 
paranoia wanted desperately to decline the food, her stomach simply could not. 
She quickly downed the meal while chatting with the man, whom she eventually 
learned was Caesar, a self-proclaimed vigilante on a mission to take down as 
many evil Bloxians as he could. Nauli admired his noble mission, and quickly 
realized that the two would pair greatly together, due to their shared 
interests. The two began to collaborate from then and onward, and have gone on 
to become an incredibly dangerous duo. Nauli's skills and psychic powers support 
Caesar while he focuses on the offense and defense. Together, very few threats 
truly stand in their way, though the Bloxiverse always has a bigger fish... 
After working together for some time, Nauli had formed a close bond with Caesar. 
This eventually lead to her being introduced to his island, and subsequently 
receiving a small plot of land for a campsite where she continues to live on 
most days.

Vortex A. Steele - Former Enemy, Close Friend & Ally:
Nauli was extremely skeptical when Caesar initially introduced Vortex as "the 
guy who tried to kill me" to her. She had little to no trust in Vortex, and it 
took some time to warm up to him. But as the days passed, she realized that 
Vortex genuinely held no ill intent, and was simply doing his job. She grew to 
respect Vortex's abilities and potential in combat, and learned to further trust 
him. Though he's hot-headed and stubborn, he has always meant well in the end. At 
times, Vortex has even collaborated alongside herself and Caesar to tackle 
particularly dangerous Bloxians as a trio.

Ren Bytera - Acquaintance:
Though Nauli never grew close to Ren in any aspects, Ren's intelligence is 
something Nauli admires. Ren is also responsible for the psy-link antennae 
augmented into Nauli's head, so naturally it would be in line to keep 
communications open. At times, Ren has directly assisted Nauli and her allies 
by studying artifacts or providing various pieces of gear and equipment for the 
team.

Bryck Manning - Defeated Enemy:
Alongside Caesar, Nauli assisted in the apprehension of Bryck Manning, a 
terrorist rampaging in a peaceful World known as the Farmer Sanctuary. Though 
she wasn't directly responsible for Bryck's subduing, she used her powers to help 
Caesar apprehend him. She was also credited when Bryck was later turned into the 
Hunter Association prior to his imprisonment.

COMBAT STYLE:
Nauli is quick, flexible, and sharp-witted. She is agile in combat and can issue 
flurries of punches or kicks with little warning. Despite her speed, she isn't 
particularly strong or durable, preferring to wear opponents down slowly until 
presented with an opportunity for a killing blow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          VORTEX A. STEELE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Noob
Age: 21
Alignment: Lawful/Neutral
Role: Judge
Ability: Chronipulation

OVERVIEW:
Vortex A. Steele is a sharp, quick-witted, and stubborn bounty hunter who holds 
the rank of second-best in the Hunter Association. Despite his small temper, he 
has a good heart and an unyielding dedication to his craft.

APPEARANCE:

Tactical:
Vortex A. Steele is an average-built Noob wrapped with a variety of belts and 
straps which cover a black t-shirt and pants. His brown, spiked hair is covered 
mostly by a black cap, while tinted shades typically hide his eyes from view.

Tactical (Geared Up):
When going into combat or performing reconnaissance, Vortex will arm himself 
with the Mag-num, a powerful revolver-sized railgun which he'll keep on his belt. 
In certain tougher missions, Vortex may also don the Amplification Gauntlet, a 
tool he'll use to breach tough structures and penetrate stronger lines of 
defense.

When using Chronipulation, chronological fabrics appear as netting along his 
limbs as his body siphons time.

PERSONALITY:
Vortex is cold, callous, and highly calculative. Aside from the few friends he 
has, Vortex's mind remains focused on his own well-being and his job as an 
operative for the Hunter Association. He is an overachiever by nature, tending to 
be stubborn and a natural perfectionist. He is sharp, quick-thinking, and 
won't take disrespect lightly. Vortex is notoriously difficult to work with, as 
he is the type to beat to his own drum and be his own boss, which can lead him 
to be a difficult ally to work with. Even when asked politely, Vortex often 
won't listen to the advice or reasoning of others unless he agrees with their 
viewpoint, often creating unnecessary tension and complications between him and 
his allies.

ABILITY - CHRONIPULATION:
Vortex was born with an innate ability enabling him to sense and contort 
temporal flows around himself and other targets, freely accelerating and 
decelerating time at will. Beyond this, Vortex can slightly alter time in other 
ways, such as rewinding back to recent moments, etc. His ability is powerful, 
versatile, and provides Vortex with a means of defeating even the most 
experienced fighters.

PASSIVE ABILITIES:
- Tempo Control: At any given time, Vortex can amplify the rate at which time 
  flows for him, allowing him to double, triple, or even quadruple his movements 
  and velocities. This allows Vortex to strike quickly and unpredictably, whilst 
  reacting almost instantaneously to incoming attacks. The faster Vortex 
  accelerates, the quicker his stamina depletes. Careful and strategic 
  management of his powers allow his true potential to shine.
- Tickrate Immunity: Chronipulation naturally nullifies the effects of temporal 
  anomalies or other powers which manipulate time in any way, preventing Vortex 
  from being affected by them.
- Echoes of Memories: On the rare occasions where Vortex's body is rewound to a 
  previous point in time, his memories are transported separately from his 
  physical form before being remembered when the rewind is complete. This allows 
  Vortex to retain clarity and a sense of continuity, even in situations where it 
  shouldn't physically be possible.
- Count The Seconds: Vortex can automatically and accurately count up to (or 
  down from) any amount of time with little to no error, as though his mind has 
  an internal clock embedded within.

OFFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Breakneck Assault: By accelerating his body, Vortex can ambush and overwhelm 
  targets with flurries of punches that blur as they travel. Though Vortex isn't 
  particularly strong by default, even stronger lines of defense can be 
  overwhelmed with thousands of punches issued in mere seconds.
- Repetition Impact: After issuing an attack such as a tackle or kick, Vortex can 
  quickly rewind to just a fraction before his hit initially landed, allowing him 
  to perform the same attack back-to-back. Attacks could theoretically be chained 
  infinitely through this method, so long as Vortex has the stamina necessary to 
  perform the (quite exhausting) rewinds.
- Back For More?: Vortex can recall a target's position and move them back to it, 
  allowing him to chain multiple attacks similar to rewinding himself. This works 
  best in tandem with a strong ally, especially those who struggle to keep 
  opponents within their range of attack.
- Acceleration Hemorrhage: Accelerating an opponent's speed can sometimes be 
  detrimental, especially if they're bleeding or suffering from other conditions 
  that worsen over time. Though this technically gives an enemy momentary 
  advantages, effects from conditions such as blood loss and poison will take hold 
  significantly faster. Though conditions to use a technique such as this are very 
  conditional, it can be a highly effective method of dispatching an enemy.

DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Temporal Afterimage: By pushing his acceleration and rapidly shifting between 
  positions, Vortex can create up to 4 indistinguishable afterimages that follow 
  his movements. They serve to confuse and disorient his targets, who often 
  struggle to deduce where to strike in order to properly hit Vortex. Most attacks 
  won't work on afterimages without significant luck or reflexes, but they are 
  extremely vulnerable to large AOE (Area of Effect) attacks such as explosions. 
  Vortex's afterimages cannot space out more than 15 studs each, without it 
  becoming impossible to maintain the illusion due to the increased distance it 
  would require to cover. Additionally, maintaining afterimages for long periods 
  of time is incredibly difficult, as Vortex must constantly work his 
  Chronipulation at high speeds-- while constantly moving between each position.
- One More Chance: When suffering from a particularly deadly wound or other 
  condition that would normally kill Vortex, he can pour his energy into a full 
  rewind of his surroundings, sending him back in time by up to a few minutes 
  before he suffered from the attack. In doing so, Vortex completely exhausts his 
  stamina reserves and momentarily cannot use Chronipulation. This lasts until 
  both he and Chronipulation can recover from the stress of rewinding large 
  portions of time. Vortex cannot use this technique effectively if even smaller 
  portions of his energy have already been used up. While rewinding time remains 
  possible even with minimal energy and stamina, the time he can rewind is 
  drastically reduced, down to mere seconds in severe cases.

UTILITARIAN TECHNIQUES:
- Chronological Anchor: Vortex can sacrifice portions of his energy, leaving them 
  in the past as marks that he can return to later. These anchors last for an 
  hour before the connection grows too weak to maintain, and can be activated 
  anytime before the deadline. They activate almost instantly when fired, 
  transporting Vortex and his memories back into the past. The anchors themselves 
  require a lengthy setup process, which prevents them from being used effectively 
  in combat unless preparation was made in advance. This setup process also takes 
  time, meaning while Vortex can often retry a lot, he can't retry forever. 
  Enough failures in a row will eventually leave him with no time to set up 
  another anchor.
- Net of Time: Vortex can lay semi-transparent nets into his surroundings, often 
  acting as traps that slow unsuspecting targets who make contact with them. 
  These web-like nets stick to targets and can be incredibly difficult to remove 
  mid-combat, especially due to the slowness they inflict. Time Nets double as 
  ordinary nets if Vortex needs them to, without slowing anything that makes 
  contact with them. This enables him to project nets for a variety of different 
  tasks, such as to catch falling objects or Bloxians. They're also great for 
  holding things in place.
- Temporal Deceleration: Vortex can significantly slow himself down, consuming 
  basically no energy to do so. Though it has no practical use in combat, 
  slowing down his own body allows him to perceive time moving faster, making it 
  a great way to skip time and wait less for things that matter to him.

DRAWBACKS:
- Unfathomable Energy Consumption: Chronipulation as a whole consumes massive 
  quantities of Vortex's stamina to maintain, especially at higher rates of 
  acceleration. Maintaining high speeds requires Vortex to get plenty of rest, 
  eat large amounts of calories, and keep a sharp mind to remain focused while 
  accelerated. Overuse of his powers is incredibly easy, and can make Vortex ill 
  and weak from the exhaustion.
- Temporal Dissociation: Constantly tampering with time has proven to have 
  adverse effects on Vortex's psyche, as he'll often dissociate or become 
  derealized by the present. It can take time for him to collect his bearings or 
  come to his senses, especially after rewinding time or slowing himself down. 
  Though these effects are often minimal and can be ignored, constant use of his 
  power has shown to cause performance issues in combat.

EQUIPMENT:

The Mag-num:
A high-caliber magnetic railgun created by Ren Bytera, which has been 
compacted down into the size and shape of a large handheld revolver. Through the 
use of electromagnets, the Mag-num can fire almost anything made of magnetized 
metal at extremely high velocities, so long as it can fit inside of the 
barrel-- though it does come with specialized ammunition designed for use with 
the gun.

Key Features:
- Target Lock: The Mag-num has built-in auto-aim functionality, allowing it to 
  strike targets with extreme accuracy and reliability. The specialized ammo 
  designed for the Mag-num remains magnetically linked to the gun, even after it 
  has left the barrel. So long as it retains a charge, Vortex can redirect the 
  trajectory of bullets, allowing him to strike targets behind walls or other 
  forms of cover. Even without the Target Lock functionality, Vortex has proven 
  himself to be an adept marksman.
- Kinetic Battery: The Mag-num doesn't rely on conventional energy seen in most 
  electric weaponry, and instead relies on recharging through physical motion 
  provided by an internal gyroscope. As Vortex moves around (especially when using 
  Chronipulation), the gun naturally feeds from the momentum to generate power.

Ammunition Types:
- Magnetic Shot: The Mag-num can charge up and fire specialized ammo by placing 
  them into the chamber. These bullets can be fired at high velocities, capable of 
  tearing through weaker materials and deeply penetrating others. When any charged 
  projectiles run out of momentum (typically once they've embedded themselves in a 
  target or structure), any remaining energy erupts in a small spark, harming 
  anything it may have stuck itself inside.
- Railshot: By holding the trigger, Vortex can delay the firing process of his 
  Mag-num. This can drastically overcharge and amplify the power behind the shot, 
  allowing the bullet to reach insane velocities and liquify most materials it 
  first comes into contact with. Bullets travelling these speeds can still be 
  redirected by the Mag-num's Target Lock, though with significantly reduced 
  turning speeds. As with the Mag-num's other projectiles, Railshot projectiles 
  erupt into a spark once they've lost their momentum, releasing any remaining 
  energy stored within. Railshot bullets often produce larger, volatile sparks 
  that shock and burn whatever they may have embedded themselves within.
- Buckshot: Using smaller magnetic shrapnel, Vortex can stuff multiple projectiles 
  into a singular chamber, before firing them all at once. In a pinch, it can make 
  for remarkably efficient crowd control, or a deadly blast for a singular, 
  close-up target. Due to the sheer quantity of bullets, the Mag-num struggles to 
  use Target Lock when firing such a large quantity at once. Unlike standard 
  bullets, Buckshot shrapnel shards do not erupt into sparks or electricity when 
  its momentum runs out, as they lack the makings of Vortex's specialized 
  ammunition.

Defensive Capabilities:
- Mag-net: By channeling the electromagnetic field used to charge and fire 
  projectiles, Vortex can sacrifice his ability to fire the weapon in exchange for 
  a barrier which catches and cancels the momentum of bullets fired towards him. 
  In addition, the Mag-num consumes the kinetic energy provided by the bullets it 
  stops, which in turn charge its battery. The Mag-num partially defends Vortex 
  against electricity as well, though it can become overloaded very quickly. The 
  Mag-net is also unable to fully halt the momentum of projectiles fired from 
  high-caliber rifles or other, stronger weaponry.

Chronipulation Enhancement:
When Vortex channels the raw energy produced by Chronipulation and imbues it into 
his Mag-num, it temporarily overclocks his weapon, transforming it into a 
devastating hand-cannon with new (and enhanced) effects. The Target Lock system 
can leech off of Chronipulation to further boost Vortex's accuracy when handling 
the weapon. On top of redirecting already-fired bullets, Chronipulation allows 
the gun to quickly amplify or decrease the speed at which a fired projectile is 
travelling. This allows it to take sharper corners or reach breakneck speeds that 
render most projectiles invisible, or at least a blur. Chronipulation-charged 
attacks consume significantly larger amounts of energy, and the kinetic battery 
can usurp portions of Vortex's Chronipulation to retain a stronger and 
longer-lasting charge.

Amplification Gauntlet:
The Amplification Gauntlet (informally known as the Amp Gauntlet) is a large, 
right-handed gauntlet which provides a significant boost to Vortex's physical 
strength, allowing him to achieve feats he couldn't achieve without it. With it, 
he can destroy most armor and reinforced structures through effort and 
dedication. It is an effective tool for tougher opponents or materials that 
require raw strength to bypass, though it is extremely heavy and greatly 
inhibits Vortex's speed while worn.

Key Features:
- Bloxite Plating: The Amp Gauntlet is partially forged of Bloxite, making it 
  near-indestructible and resistant to most forms of blunt-force damage, along 
  with a majority of environmental hazards.

Offensive Techniques:
- Heavy Impact: The Amp Gauntlet allows Vortex to amplify the raw kinetic 
  strength behind his swings through electromagnets, allowing him to tear through 
  a majority of tough materials, including reinforced concrete and rebar.
- Thumper: By pressing his fist to the ground and smashing down repeatedly, he can 
  create shockwaves that repel targets and produce a concussive blast that stuns 
  and discombobulates anyone nearby.

Chronipulation Enhancement:
By pouring vast quantities of the energy produced by Chronipulation into the Amp 
Gauntlet, Vortex can imbue the gauntlet with his energy, drastically improving 
the strength and speed behind it, alongside unlocking new techniques. Through 
Chronipulation, Vortex can delay the effects of the Amp Gauntlet's attacks for 
multiple minutes or hours if he so chooses, allowing him to "store" the kinetic 
energy for use later. By striking the same target multiple times, Vortex can 
release the delay for all of his attacks at once, instantaneously applying the 
force behind each one to the struck target(s) at once. Thanks to Chronipulation, 
Vortex can heavily improve his ability to wield the gauntlet with speed and 
precision previously unmanageable. It's still slower than using no gauntlet at 
all, but an improvement is an improvement. On top of the strong impacts the Amp 
Gauntlet can deal out, Chronipulation allows struck targets to have their 
position rewound to be struck again. While rewinding the physical position of 
targets other than himself is extremely draining, chaining multiple hits on a 
target can quickly incapacitate them and make for a quick end to a fight. When 
using the Thumper technique, a web of Chronipulation spreads out across the 
shockwaved area, automatically triggering if a target steps into range. Making 
contact with this web drastically reduces the rate at which time flows across 
their body, making them more susceptible and weak to the shockwaves produced by 
thumping the ground. Retracting his fist from the ground immediately dissipates 
the web.

Drawbacks:
The Amp Gauntlet is extremely heavy, comparable to Vortex's own body weight and 
then some. On top of drastically reducing Vortex's mobility, proper control 
requires extreme care and concentration. It can be easy for him to tip over and 
lose his balance from the sheer weight if he isn't focused or lacks the 
necessary stamina. The amount of energy siphoned by the device to enable 
functionality at higher speeds is unimaginably large, capable of exhausting 
Vortex in a few mere swings. In most cases, Vortex can only overclock the Amp 
Gauntlet in desperate situations, or sparingly throughout a battle.

HISTORY:

Creation:
Vortex (at the time known as Volkan) was born into a poor, but loving family 
between two Noobs a few years prior to the disappearance of Roblox. He and his 
family spent their life on the run, as the constant emergence of new Robloxians 
meant chaos and disorder while society itself was adjusting. Though his life was 
minimalistic and no members of his family were special, he loved them dearly and 
was content with the life he lived. He always loved to go above and beyond for 
his parents, catering to their every need and always checking in to make sure 
they were alright. Life was small, but life was good, and Volkan was happy.

Times of Change:
Whether it be time or another force, all good things must come to an end. 
Volkan's parents were already quite old when Vortex was born, and over the years 
they had slowed down significantly. His father was first to pass, going 
peacefully in his sleep. His heartbroken mother followed soon after, leaving 
Volkan with nobody but himself. For a time, he felt lost and confused. His 
family was his entire world, and now he was the only part of that world 
remaining. Volkan fell into a deep depression, alone and purposeless. He was 
talented, but what point was there in using that talent if his beloved parents 
weren't around to see it? He couldn't bring himself to do much of anything for 
the longest time, lazing around and contemplating life. He was beaten up by his 
thoughts, telling him that he didn't spend enough time with them. Fortunately, 
Volkan was a tough cookie and eventually came to his own understanding that 
rotting away doing nothing is not what his mother and father would've wanted. 
They were always encouraging throughout his life, and this would have been no 
different. So, he gathered his resolve and pressed onwards to achieve something 
in life.

The Association:
Volkan got to work on self-improvement, looking to get back into shape and 
recover after letting himself go as he did. Over a few years, he'd focus on his 
body and train to bring himself back to a healthy status. But, Volkan ended up 
becoming addicted to the results. Even after getting back to the way he was, he 
pressed onwards in an effort to maximize his potential. His track running and 
stretching paid off significantly, as Volkan became quite an agile and flexible 
individual. Though he continued to train, he eventually hit the ceiling of 
physical potential he had, and only then was Volkan satisfied. But, in doing 
so he had gathered the attention of another.

An old, elderly man approached Volkan one day, complimenting him on his prowess 
and determination. He went on to mention how Volkan had the skills and physique, 
yet no work to apply them to. The two chatted and eventually became friendly 
with one another, before Volkan was referred to the Hunter Association for a 
line of work the man believed he would specialize in. Volkan spent a long time 
debating whether he'd want to partake in that kind of dirtier work, but he 
eventually pushed himself to do it, and visited their headquarters. The old man 
was there to greet him, eventually revealing himself to be Jhustice, one of the 
councilmen for the Hunter Association. He praised Volkan for taking the offer, 
and walked him through his initiation and the inner workings of the faction.

After he had signed his contract, Volkan underwent a rigorous process to 
prepare himself to become a hunter. His identity was scrubbed away from any 
public records as he underwent intense psychological evaluations, determining 
his mental fortitude and his resolve. Volkan passed the tests with flying 
colors, and was eventually accepted to become a low-rank initiative for the 
Hunter Association. It was at this point where Volkan would surrender his 
identity fully to the association, becoming Vortex and leaving his past life 
behind. Despite this, he always made sure to keep his beloved parents in the 
back of his mind, as motivation and as a reminder of what he's working for.

An Awakening:
Vortex ended up being perfect for the position, exactly as Jhustice predicted. 
He was quick, quiet, and excelled in gathering intel for future bounties. Even 
without any powers, Vortex was effective in hand-to-hand combat against weaker 
enemies, thanks to his sharper reflexes. He was a reliable asset to the 
association, and they saw more potential within him. It wasn't long before the 
Hunter Association began to push Vortex even further, placing him in charge of 
tougher contracts. Though he struggled to keep up with the pacing, he was able 
to succeed even when constantly pressed by tougher missions and opponents. This, 
however, would only serve to make the association want more out of him.

Eventually, Vortex was promoted to a stage-one mercenary, marking a turning 
point where hunters would start being assigned bounties that target Bloxians 
with special abilities. Vortex thought little of it, believing in himself as he 
always had. No matter the target, he'd be sure to take them down, or so his 
mindset led him to believe. One day, Vortex was issued a large-scale contract, 
grouped together with a large handful of other hunters. They had received word 
of a Robloxian World that had its population massacred, before it was destroyed 
by a villain identified as the Scarlet Flame. The association made sure to press 
the details, ensuring that the assigned group was aware that he was not to be 
taken lightly.

The squadron was mobilized, with Vortex leading reconnaissance. They were given 
basic information on the Scarlet Flame's whereabouts, and eventually managed to 
locate him. They had the tactical initiative and struck first, but it quickly 
became apparent that they were significantly unprepared-- and underpowered. The 
Scarlet Flame quickly began to massacre the squadron, taking out multiple at a 
time. Members were incinerated alive, leaving nothing but floating dust and 
death. For the first time, Vortex felt genuine fear and realized that he could 
not combat someone as strong as the Scarlet Flame, and began to flee as the 
other members held the villain off for as long as they could.

It wasn't long before the Scarlet Flame had ended the lives of every squad 
member, aside from Vortex who was attempting to retreat. His heart was pounding, 
and adrenaline coursed through his veins. He sensed the Scarlet Flame's presence 
growing closer, and knew he wouldn't be able to outrun him. He needed to go 
faster. He NEEDED to go faster. HE NEEDED TO GO FASTER!

Vortex's entire body was driven by fear and the deep desire to flee the Scarlet 
Flame, causing him to awaken his latent abilities that had been present all 
along. His body lurched forward as his speed multiplied ten-fold, enabling Vortex 
to soar forwards and quickly escape from the conflict. With his adrenaline 
pumping and his thoughts racing, he had no time to question what was happening, 
fully committed to getting away. Barely holding control of the blitzing speeds he 
was travelling, Vortex successfully managed to reach the headquarters of the 
Hunter Association, crashing into their lawn at full speed before passing out 
from the impact.

Becoming an Elite:
Vortex was initially reprimanded for fleeing the scene of combat, but their 
tone quickly changed when Vortex explained what had happened. The entire squad was 
massacred, and Vortex remained unsure as to how he had even escaped the conflict. 
The Association sent him to the medical bay to recover, and to later run tests 
on his body to understand what had happened. The examinations went on to show 
that Vortex was not an ordinary Noob, and had awakened an ability during his 
conflict with the Scarlet Flame, likely due to the stress and fear created by 
the encounter and witnessing the death of his squadron. They encouraged Vortex 
to practice, believing that he could learn to control this ability and hone it 
to become a greater hunter than he had already proven himself to be.

The scientists were correct in their assumptions, and through practice and 
mental control, Vortex learned to channel his ability, dubbed 'Chronipulation' by 
the team who did research on him. Through it, he could amplify his body and 
senses further, turning him into a purple blur that almost nobody could keep up 
with. It took practice and precise control to properly manage, but Vortex 
learned to use it as an extension of his being, turning it into a powerful 
weapon and tool. Though rematching the Scarlet Flame was out of the question (as 
the whereabouts of the villain had long-since become unknown), Vortex went on to 
continue as an operative and climbed the ranks. Over the next few years, he'd 
maximize his ranking and eventually go on to become an Elite, the highest rank 
within their hierarchy. He was praised for his dedication and hard work, and 
Jhustice held a celebration. It had been a long time since the last hunter had 
reached an Elite status. From then on, he was provided with a penthouse suite 
and all of the amenities he could dream of. Vortex had finally earned a life 
for himself that his parents would've been proud of, and in that he found 
happiness and satisfaction.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:

Caesar Bloxwright - Former Contract / Enemy, Close Friend & Ally:
Vortex was originally contracted by the Hunter Association to eliminate Caesar, 
which had been issued by a petty Bryck Manning after his fall and imprisonment 
during the conflict at the Farmer Sanctuary. What followed was a long, 
drawn-out game of cat-and-mouse. Vortex pursued Caesar relentlessly, using his 
skills in reconnaissance to track Caesar down and corner him. Eventually, he 
managed to ambush Caesar in a remote warehouse where the two engaged in combat. 
Though as the fight went on, it was clear to see that Caesar wasn't possible for 
Vortex to eliminate, nor could Caesar eliminate Vortex. Their abilities cancelled 
out the effects of one another, and it ended up causing the two to exhaust one 
another of their energy and stamina. In the end, Vortex stopped trying and spoke 
with Caesar. Through their conversation, they grew to understand each of their 
motivations, and Vortex understood that whoever had issued the contract was the 
one truly in the wrong. Torn between failing a contract or killing an innocent 
man, he ultimately made the difficult decision to forfeit the contract. From 
then on, Vortex kept in contact with Caesar as the two grew to become genuine 
friends and allies, often teaming up to tackle tougher contracts that they 
couldn't complete alone.

Nauli Parter - Close Friend & Ally:
Vortex was introduced to Nauli through his connection to Caesar, with the pair 
becoming friends after Nauli finally lowered her guard and began to trust him. 
Though it was rocky at first, Vortex and Nauli have grown to work together in 
tandem, often alongside Caesar as the three tackle missions together.

Ren Bytera - Acquaintance:
Though Vortex has never been close with Ren in any respects, she is responsible 
for the creation of his Mag-num as well as his Amplification Gauntlet. They're 
effective and durable, and have served Vortex very well. They've only spoken on 
occasion, but Vortex has made it very clear that he admires her craft, even if 
her lack of morals is something he finds unsavory.

Charles Studson - Rival:
Both Vortex and Charles have been competing for recognition within the Hunter 
Association. Charles is relatively new to the faction in comparison to Vortex, 
though his Chainipulation abilities have allowed him to climb the ranks almost 
as quickly as Vortex once did. They naturally share a competitive nature, which 
has led to a fierce rivalry between the two. Despite Charles' reputation rapidly 
increasing, he always seems to remain a step behind Vortex no matter what he 
seems to do. Perhaps it requires more than chains to defeat a time manipulator? 
What a thought.

Bryck Manning - Enemy:
Vortex was originally assigned the contract against Caesar that Bryck had 
placed, and Bryck was infuriated to know that not only had his hunter failed-- 
but he had gone on to become friends with Caesar. This has left him incredibly 
bitter and hateful of Vortex, unbeknownst to Vortex himself who is entirely 
unaware of who Bryck is.

COMBAT STYLES:
Vortex primarily relies on his heightened agility, quick thinking, and 
incredible precision. He is a master of body language and can often predict 
movements of targets before they attack. His combat potential multiplies with 
his equipment and Chronipulation.

              PART IV: DEUTERAGONISTS & NEUTRAL CHARACTERS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            RICE FARMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Noob
Age: 55
Alignment: Neutral/Moral
Role: Altruist
Ability: None

OVERVIEW:
Rice Farmer (often abbreviated to just "Rice") is a gentle and hardworking 
deuteragonist who tends to the rice crops in the Farmer's Sanctuary. Known for 
his simple lifestyle and positive outlook on life, Rice brings joy to those 
around him.

APPEARANCE:
Rice Farmer is a standard-height Noob. He has pale, peachy skin (especially so 
for a Noob) and clothing which hides his blue torso and green legs, often 
causing others to confuse him as a Robloxian. He is often seen in a blue variant 
of the uniform worn by most who reside within the Farmer Sanctuary, a shirt which 
has been strapped down by brown overalls and a belt. He wears a straw-knit cone 
hat, obscuring his bare head and forehead from view. A brown pouch is hoisted 
onto the strap of his overall, providing him space to hold seeds and other small 
goods. Rice almost always carries a large rake around while working on the farm. 
It is nearly double his own height, and he clearly struggles to wield it at 
times.

PERSONALITY:
Rice is a gentle, simplistic soul who loves nothing more than his honest work as 
a farmer. Easygoing and kind, Rice carries an aura of peace wherever he goes. He 
values all life and treats everyone equally and with respect.

Rice has a strong distaste for conflict and will actively avoid it whenever 
possible. He believes it's better to submit and comply when faced with 
antagonism, fearing potential consequences.

HISTORY:

Grown With Care:
Many, many years ago, there was a farmer known as Ahlias. He was born into the 
Farmer Sanctuary by a loving mother and father, alongside two brothers known as 
Jeremiah and Bolos. From a young age, he and his siblings were trained in the 
ways of agriculture, raised with a deep connection for the plants they would 
inherit and cater towards as adults. They all exceeded the expectations of their 
parents, especially Ahlias; He was known to work particularly hard without 
tiring or showing signs of stress. Eventually, the brothers matured, and the 
time came for them to inherit their own plots of land within the sanctuary. A 
ceremony was held in celebration, a night that all three brothers remember 
fondly. Ahlias was quieter and shy, but even he enjoyed being the center of 
attention. Though eventually, the party came to an end and Ahlias, Jeremiah, and 
Bolos were officially positioned within their own plots. This marked a turning 
point in their lives, officially entering adulthood. As time went on, Ahlias 
became the caretaker for the farm's rice supplies, while Jeremiah did so with 
wheat, and Bolos did so with the peach orchard. It took time for the trio to 
become used to their new positions, often looking back fondly on the memories 
they had when they were younger. They missed working together every day, living 
a happy and carefree lifestyle. It was melancholic to reminisce on the memories, 
but the brothers felt fulfilled by the new duties given to them. They were happy, 
and all was well.

Ruin:
One fateful morning, Ahlias awoke to the smell of smoke and the sounds of 
shouting from outside his barn. He peered through the window, his heart sinking 
as he quickly realized what was happening. A group of bandits were tearing apart 
the sanctuary and ransacking their supplies. Embers swirled through the air as 
nearby buildings blazed, many farmers laying motionless on the dirt. Their bodies 
were either beaten, burned, flayed, or twisted into impossible positions. 
Ahlias watched in horror, unsure of what to do. He hesitated, countless thoughts 
flooding his mind. Where were his brothers, or his parents? What did the 
intruders want, why were they here? Ahlias quickly snatched his rake from the 
wall and held it tightly to his chest, his body frozen from a mix of 
indecisiveness and fear. Ahlias knew that the bandits would inevitably kill him 
if he were to try and confront them, but could he really leave his family to die? 
Before he had a chance to resolve his decision, a molotov crashed through his 
window and lit his room ablaze, forcing Ahlias to flee his room as well as the 
barn. He was quickly cast into the fray outside.

Ahlias ran from his home as quickly as he could, diving into a thick shrub where 
he crashed into Jeremiah, who was also hiding inside. Ahlias tried to question 
the situation, but Jeremiah explained that as far as he knew, the attack had 
just begun. They waited patiently from within the bush, stifling their cries and 
holding each other close, ignoring the crashing and screaming as best they 
could. They feared that when the bandits finally leave the sanctuary, they would 
be the only two left. They tried to suppress the thoughts, remaining still and 
horrified until the yelling of many became fewer. Ahlias nor Jeremiah could 
bear the unknown, especially after all had fallen silent around them-- save for 
the crackling of barns and plants still smouldering from the fires. They came 
to an agreement to peek out and see the damages, and eventually did so despite 
the hesitation. Peering out into their surroundings, they were circled by 
countless mutilated bodies, collapsed ruins, and dying flames. Ahlias couldn't 
help but scream from the sights, which would prove to be a grave mistake. A few 
of the invaders were still nearby and heard Ahlias' cries, quickly swarming the 
pair and cornering them.

Just as the bandits lunged towards the duo to slaughter them, Bolos emerged from 
around the corner and charged down the group. Bolos wasted no time and took 
advantage of his surprise attack, smashing down the intruders and beating them 
senselessly until they no longer moved. Some of them tried to resist, but Bolos 
held overwhelming strength and resolve, eventually bending and breaking them one 
by one. The other bandits had watched Bolos annihilate multiple of their men at 
once, and decided to retreat early on with the supplies they had already claimed. 
Bolos tried to chase them down as they fled the world, but Jeremiah convinced 
him to stop and help the survivors instead.

With the brothers properly reunited amidst the chaos, they began to search and 
rescue any survivors of the attack, though most were fatally wounded or had 
already passed on from their injuries. It wasn't long before they stumbled upon 
their mother and father, quickly rushing to their aid. Their father was already 
dead from his wounds, cut and drained of his blood. Their mother laid on the 
ground, partially crushed under the rubble of a building that had collapsed from 
the fire. Bolos quickly freed and carried their mother and father away, leaving 
Ahlias and Jeremiah to continue their search and put out the remaining fires. 
Some time later, their mother eventually fell into a coma and passed away soon 
after in her sleep. In the span of a morning, everything they had achieved 
in life was ripped away from them. The population of the sanctuary was cut by 
almost 85%, leaving the brothers and a handful of survivors to rebuild from the 
ashes.

Reconstruction:
It took many years for the remaining survivors to properly recover, both 
physically and emotionally. Many of them were left permanently disabled or 
critically wounded, while others dealt with trauma far beyond the point of 
recovery. Jeremiah fell into a depressive spiral, while Bolos was left with a 
spinal injury from the conflict. Ahlias battled with his own emotional struggles, 
but he put them aside to keep a smile on his face and assist his brothers in 
their recovery, doing what he could to make sure they stayed happy and motivated. 
Eventually, the Farmer Sanctuary recovered from the attack, though the size of 
the village had been significantly reduced, mainly due to the loss of their 
people. Decades passed, but the sanctuary eventually returned to their golden 
age once again. With age came acceptance for the brothers, who regularly held a 
ceremony in honor of the fallen, just as the fallen had once held a ceremony 
for them. During one of these ceremonies, Ahlias announced that he'd be 
changing his name to honor their parents, planning to adopt his mother's 
nickname 'Ricey'. Ahlias went on to become Rice, and eventually his brothers 
also decided to participate in the honoring. Jeremiah changed his name to Whyeet 
to honor the crop their father had assigned him to, while Bolos became Peaches to 
honor the orchard his mother gifted him. Rice decided to take and wear the wicker 
cone his father once wore, while Whyeet took their mother's and Peaches took 
their late grandmother's. From then on, their new identities were set in stone, 
and their life continued on the path to produce. It was a moment of growth for 
the trio, although bittersweet.

                            BUILDERMAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Noob
Age: N/A (Divine Youth)
Alignment: Lawful/Good
Role: Paladin
Ability: Creation (Divine Gift)

OVERVIEW:
Builderman is the cheery and energetic leader of the Buildermen faction, 
bestowed with divine creation powers by Roblox themselves. He is somewhat of a 
celebrity, recognized for his generosity and incredible potential for good.

APPEARANCE:

Modern:
Builderman is an average-built Noob, with noticeably-unique skin tones that 
normally do not appear within the Noobish race. While his head is the standard 
yellow seen on most Noobs, his torso is orange whilst his arms and legs are a 
deep greyish-blue. Most of his skin is covered by his working suit, a grey 
strap-belt jacket with a hood and grey pants. His hood is almost always up, 
obscuring a black and orange hardhat he wears. He is often seen with a utility 
belt, a variety of tools hoisted neatly across the front. Underneath his 
clothing, a tattoo of a wrench was plastered across his chest by Roblox, a 
symbol of his importance and position as the Builderman. Builderman can choose 
whether his mark is hidden completely, visible underneath his clothing, or 
present above his clothing. Builderman carries the Banhammer on his person at 
all times, usually hovering idly behind his back, or shrunk down to fit in a 
pocket for subtlety or convenience.

Legacy:
During the ancient times, Builderman's unique skin tones were much more 
apparent, as he wore nothing beyond white pauldrons, his hard hat and various 
bandages. Such attire was necessary for protection and good health, especially 
during the Great Guesticide and the war that came with it. The wrench marking 
was much more visible and covered most of his chest, present over the bandages 
wrapped across his body. Even in these times, Builderman always kept the 
Banhammer within reach, especially so during the darker ages of the Bloxiverse.

PERSONALITY:

Modern:
Builderman is a cheery, easygoing and very upstanding man. He is a natural 
leader and full of determination, qualities necessary to run his faction—the 
Buildermen. He can be a showoff at times, especially when he is around Bloxians he 
wishes to impress, but it is all well-intentioned in the end, done for good fun 
and never purely to gloat about his abilities. He always acts as a 
people-pleaser, whether intentionally or subconsciously. He is entirely against 
violence and disorder, and quickly becomes flustered when any kind of fighting 
happens, especially when it is physical. He carries trauma from his legacy of 
bloodshed during the war, triggered easily by reminders or stress. He hates to 
relive the events that transpired during those years, and the lives he had to end 
as a result of it.

Legacy:
During the early years of the Bloxiverse, Builderman had a much larger role 
within the Bloxiverse. He was chosen by Roblox to act as a guardian and 
peacekeeper, tasked to act as a beacon of hope and security for the Guests. This 
was already very stressful for Builderman, and things only grew worse as the 
war broke out. His heroic persona quickly fell apart under the tension, and he 
was eventually forced to choose sides, becoming a military leader for the Noobs. 
He became colder, distancing himself from reality and doing his best to commit 
atrocities to Guestkind with blind eyes. Once the war was over and the last 
known Guests were annihilated, Builderman retired to recover both physically and 
mentally from the PTSD he had developed. It would take many, many years for 
Builderman to stabilize himself and put the events that transpired behind him.

ABILITY - CREATION:
Builderman may manifest any object, structure, or construct from nothing at any 
given moment, so long as they can properly fathom the form, composition, and 
function. Creation has a limited range of 10,000 x 10,000 studs per-construct. 
"Impossible" objects, such as 4-D (four-dimensional) constructs or non-euclidean 
geometry are impossible to create, as they bend the natural laws imposed by the 
Bloxiverse, and cannot be entirely fathomed by 3-D (three-dimensional) beings.

Unlike other Noobs, Builderman can also create Robloxian Worlds—normally an 
ability exclusive to Robloxians.

PASSIVE ABILITIES:
- Spatial Intuition: Within the 10,000 x 10,000 stud range of Builderman's 
  ability, he is granted an innate awareness of his surroundings. This makes it 
  incredibly difficult to sneak up on Builderman, or do something without his 
  knowledge.
- Subconsciously Familiar: The more Builderman fathoms specific objects into 
  existence, the easier it becomes to do again for that particular object in the 
  future. The more he understands what it is he creates, the faster and more 
  efficiently he can produce that object in particular.
- Adaptive Reinforcement: Created objects will begin to self-optimize against 
  stress, damage, or misuse, so long as Builderman remains conscious and within 
  the 10,000 x 10,000 stud range.
- Object Permanence: Even after constructs leave the 10,000 x 10,000 stud radius, 
  they continue to exist, for as long as the materials the object is made of 
  continue to hold up.

OFFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Immediate Armament: Builderman is capable of fathoming weapons directly into 
  his hands or the surrounding area, depending on what the situation demands. 
  Blades, firearms, cannons, bombs and more are all plausible options.
- Constructive Crush: Builderman can fathom extremely large constructs above his 
  enemy, bringing them down to flatten them under immense weight. Typically, 
  he'll create buildings to do so, or large solid cubes of heavy materials such 
  as iron or stone.
- Potential Bomb: By straining his mind and intentionally thinking unclearly, 
  Builderman can create deadly explosions of raw potential, unleashing a slurry 
  of various materials and half-complete constructs in all directions. This 
  technique may unintentionally activate if Builderman is under significant 
  stress, though it grows stronger as he becomes more and more desperate.
- Environmental Weaponization: Builderman can utilize the environment to his 
  advantage, building his constructs off of the conditions he may find himself 
  in. He can conjure spikes of stone in tight spaces, create pitfalls by 
  detonating bombs underground. It all depends on where Builderman may find 
  himself in that moment.

DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Instantaneous Bulwark: When in danger, Builderman can conjure durable 
  materials into powerful shields and barriers to defend him from incoming 
  enemy attacks. Simple barriers and defensive bulwarks can be created much 
  faster than weapons, due to the simplicity and often-high urgency.
- Dynamic Armor: Builderman can surround his body with a variety of different 
  materials, flowing around him and creating a protective layer. This armor can 
  change materials and size as-per Builderman's requirements, adapting to 
  tolerate things like concussive force, intense heat, electricity, etc.
- Emergency Reconstruction: If a defensive (or offensive) construct is 
  destroyed in combat, a simpler "fallback" version can instantly be created in 
  its place. Fallback constructs are typically much weaker than their 
  well-thought counterparts.

UTILITARIAN TECHNIQUES:
- Architectural Genesis: So long as it remains within the 10,000 x 10,000 stud 
  limit, Builderman can fathom large-scale architecture on a whim, creating 
  entire cities or operational facilities within the spatial limit. A new home 
  is never more than a wave of the hand away, and imprisoning enemies in a 
  metal labyrinth has never been easier.
- Infinitool: Builderman ALWAYS has the necessary tool for the job, capable of 
  fathoming just about any equipment he needs to complete just about any job. The 
  tools on his belt were also made through his abilities.
- Sustenance Fathoming: Whether he or another Bloxian is hungry or thirsty, 
  Builderman can generate liquids and foods on a whim.

ULTIMATE TECHNIQUES:
- World Expansion: In a pinch or against particularly tough opponents, 
  Builderman can construct temporary worlds to contain enemies. These temporary 
  worlds do not follow the typical bounds set by normal Robloxian Worlds, and 
  can have specialized effects or architecture, often designed around hindering 
  or eliminating whatever may be inside. The effects of temporary worlds range 
  widely, but typically get stuffed full of hazardous materials. Entire worlds 
  made purely of fire or radiation, walls that close in on all sides, worlds of 
  pure water to drown enemies. The only limit is his imagination.
- Colossa-Cannon: Builderman can fathom a singular, supermassive cannon which 
  completely covers the 10,000 x 10,000 stud limit. This cannon fires with enough 
  force to shake entire quadrants of the Bloxiverse, temporarily outshining the 
  Heart. The blast easily annihilates entire worlds that are struck by the beam, 
  only ceasing when Builderman cannot maintain the cannon any longer. Such a 
  massively-powerful construct is extremely taxing on Builderman's mind and 
  body. The last use of this technique occurred during the Great Guesticide, 
  after which Builderman fell into a deep coma for multiple weeks.

DRAWBACKS:
- Cognitive Overload: Creating too much, too fast can cause Builderman to become 
  overwhelmed by his own thoughts and the flow of creation, nullifying his 
  ability entirely until he can clear his mind and refocus.
- Thought Decay: If Builderman rapidly creates constructs over and over, they 
  become more and more misshapen overtime. Significant stress or a lack of energy 
  and effort can cause objects to have deformities and become completely 
  non-functional.
- Physical Drainage: High-powered constructs (such as cannons, vehicles, etc.) 
  quickly exhaust Builderman when created en masse, requiring him to plan 
  carefully in order to continue using his ability over a long span of time.

HISTORY:

Establishment:
Builderman was originally an unnamed Noob, born alongside the first batch of 
Noobkind, created by Roblox to fill the Bloxiverse with life beyond the Guests. 
Roblox was still heavily involved with the security and development of the 
Bloxiverse by this point, allowing the Noobs and Guests to interact with Roblox 
himself. Roblox and Builderman grew close in particular, Roblox found 
Builderman's natural kindness and humble personality to be endearing. 
Builderman was the first Noob—and the first Bloxian—to successfully befriend 
god, and all it took was being himself.

One day, Roblox approached Builderman with a proposition; He wished for 
Builderman to become an authority within the Bloxiverse, asking him to help 
create worlds that would eventually be inhabited by future Noobs. Builderman was 
honored and bewildered at the idea, accepting with no hesitation—doing so without 
consideration for the duties that would come with this role. In the end, he was 
chosen to be bestowed a fraction of Roblox's power, granting him the spark of 
creation—something no Guest or Noob has ever received to-date. This spark would 
grant him the incredible powers of creation, alongside a significant boost in 
power and eternal youth. From that point on, Roblox named him the 'Builderman', 
the first Bloxian to create entire worlds in the name of Roblox.

Roblox was not blind to the potential dangers that would arise for Builderman, 
especially while acting as Roblox's right-hand man. To help Builderman defend 
himself and channel the spark of creation he had been blessed with, Roblox 
forged a legendary tool to assist him. From this, the Banhammer was born and 
bestowed upon Builderman as a gift.

Racial Conflicts:
Time had passed since Builderman had become a creator, and tensions had begun 
to rise between the Guests and the Noobs. Roblox feared the worst and inquired 
with Builderman, looking for a levelheaded perspective on the situation to better 
judge his next course of action. Builderman believed it was better to let things 
play out naturally for the Bloxians, fearing that Roblox's creations may turn 
on him if he were to pick sides. Roblox took note of Builderman's advice, letting 
him return to his duties.

Eventually, what Roblox predicted would come to pass. A great war known in 
history as the Guesticide had begun, a retaliation organized by the Guests due 
to the feelings of inferiority they felt. Builderman first tried to calm things 
between the two sides, but the Guests eventually started to attack Builderman as 
well. The Noobs were hesitant to retaliate, but Builderman gathered the courage 
and rallied them together, knowing they would need to defend themselves against 
such stubborn opponents. Builderman set himself into the position as a military 
leader for the Noobs, and went on to charge into many battles alongside them. 
Builderman despised every second of it, knowing the suffering he was inflicting 
on those poor souls, who only wanted recognition and appreciation. He couldn't 
help but wonder why they had gone about getting attention this way.

The war raged on for an amount of time Builderman didn't care to recall, he was 
too busy dissociating from the conflict. It was clear that the Noobs truly were 
superior in the end, because they had soon wiped all known Guests completely off 
of the map. Builderman quickly retired as the leader of the Noobs, retreating to 
hide away for multiple years as he recovered from the trauma and PTSD he had 
gone on to develop from the slaughter.

The Recovery:
Eventually, Builderman returned to a healthy state of mind, though permanently 
scarred by trauma impossible to shake. He set out on a journey of repentance and 
forgiveness, desiring to clear his soul and mind of the atrocities he had no 
choice but to commit. He began small, doing odd jobs and quick favors for 
strangers. He knew it barely made an impact, but it still helped to clear his 
conscience a bit. Things would progress quickly, his favors and actions growing 
larger and larger as he became more absorbed in the joy he felt from helping 
others. He realized that his gift from Roblox could be used beyond the creation 
of Worlds, that it could be used to meet the needs of Bloxians. A thought struck 
Builderman's mind, one that would change the course of his life forever. Maybe 
beyond the creation of Worlds, this was his true purpose? He could do more than 
expand, he could further help what was already made. This change of thought would 
be a turning point for Builderman, who began looking into the creation of a 
charity, one that could provide resources to those in need.

The Building Men:
This dedication would eventually culminate into a small faction, run by 
Builderman and a few volunteers. They were known as the Buildermen, dispersing 
necessities to Bloxians far and wide. Builderman would handle the creation of 
these resources, while his assistants would handle the distribution of these 
goods. Their charity quickly picked up traction, with more volunteers wishing to 
help out, and larger demands appearing as the Buildermen society established 
themselves. The operation grew rapidly, and Builderman was riding the highs of 
success. For a while, the Buildermen held steady in their work, and many Noobs 
got just about anything they could've needed for their survival. It was brief, 
but beautiful golden age for both Builderman and the Bloxiverse.

End Of An Era:
Eventually would come the day where Roblox would disappear forever, without so 
much as a word—not even a goodbye. This broke Builderman's heart for a long time, 
wondering if he and Roblox were truly friends. He swallowed his doubts, believing 
that Roblox surely wouldn't disappear without any reason. Besides, he had no 
time to worry about Roblox, as the Robloxians had arrived right as Roblox 
disappeared—as though it were a final gift for the Bloxiverse.

Naturally, chaos quickly ensued from the arrival of the Robloxians, making the 
Buildermen and their jobs even more important than they already were. Demands for 
supplies and Worlds skyrocketed as the Bloxiverse's economy struggled to adapt to 
the sudden influx of Bloxians. It was during this insanity where Builderman 
first met Bloxxanne, a girl born with a knack for inventing. Builderman quickly 
grew attached to her, and the pair became great friends. Eventually, Bloxxanne 
began climbing the ranks of the Buildermen, which would quickly lead her to 
become Builderman's right hand woman, valued for her intelligence, ingenuity, 
and companionship.

Soon would come the modern day, where the Buildermen continue their operation 
with Builderman and Bloxxanne at the front. Builderman still longs for the day 
Roblox returns, but his faith crumbles more and more with each passing day. Even 
so, he holds the memories he made with Roblox dearly, lamenting about the simpler 
times before he had become the Builderman. His struggles with PTSD continue, but 
each day he grows a little stronger, even if by only a pinch.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:

Bloxxanne Whelder - Close Friend / Romantic Interest:
Builderman and Bloxxanne have been together since the earlier days of the 
Buildermen faction, closely-knit for as long as they can remember. She has 
helped Builderman through the darkest of times, always being there for him 
during his manic episodes and panic attacks from his PTSD. Together, they have 
managed to run the Buildermen for years and years, and their operation only 
seems to be growing stronger with each passing day. Builderman secretly has 
feelings for Bloxxanne, doing his best to shove them down and hide them from 
her. He fears that she wouldn't reciprocate how he feels, and that if she did, 
it would only be out of pity.

LIFESTYLE:

The Buildermen:
Builderman is the founder and director for the Buildermen, a faction dedicated 
to the production and distribution of material goods for Bloxians in need. He 
has established himself as a known celebrity, praised by many for his 
selflessness and honorable charity work. He doesn't like the public attention, 
crediting his many employees despite operating as the backbone of the Buildermen, 
singlehandedly making the entire operation possible. Aside from explicit 
interviews and meetings, he has positioned his closest friend and highest-ranked 
employee, Bloxxanne Whelder, to stay in charge of the public fronts, as he 
tends to get nervous and tense from the publicity. Even hidden from the public 
eye, Builderman always tries to outdo himself in his work, using his resources 
and abilities to make sure that the Buildermen can always provide for the needy 
at any hour of the day.

Free Time:
Builderman has very little time to himself outside of work, even while living 
within the headquarters for the Buildermen. His work is intensive and exhausting, 
leaving Builderman with a desire to sleep when his quota for the day has finally 
been met. With the little time he does have in the end, he enjoys watching TV 
and painting. He has a particular affinity for art, fascinated by the process. He 
has been unable to properly replicate artwork with the ability of creation, 
leading him to paint in an effort to learn and understand what defines a piece as 
'art'.

COMBAT STYLES:

Standard:
Builderman is a smart, physically-blessed fighter who is dangerous even without 
the use of his ability. His countless years of war and battle have turned him 
into an effective tactician, capable of quickly analyzing and creating counters 
for his opponents mid-combat. He aims to maintain consistent pressure on his 
opponents, striking carefully and critically to quickly break the defenses of 
his targets down.

The Banhammer:
Through the power contained within the Banhammer, Builderman becomes 
immeasurably powerful, capable of attacking with strength that obliterates matter 
from reality itself. The strength of the swing does not matter, but rather 
Builderman's intent on what he wishes to erase. So he wishes, Builderman has to 
do nothing more than tap the surface of the Banhammer's head on a target for its 
ability to take effect. Certain matter is impossible for the Banhammer to erase, 
primarily gasses (including air) and specific liquids.

Key Techniques:
- Absolute Erasure: Through one swing of the Banhammer, any target can be 
  completely annihilated from reality itself, not even an atomic trace left 
  behind. The size of the target—nor any defenses they may have set up—can do 
  anything to stop the Banhammer's ability from activating. One swing will always 
  do the trick, every time. The sole exception to the Banhammer depends on the 
  matter Builderman is swinging at. Gasses (such as air) and certain liquids do 
  not trigger the Banhammer's ability.
- Pylon of Annihilation: By planting the handle of the Banhammer into the 
  ground, it begins to radiate an aura of pure obliteration, erasing anything 
  that steps within—aside from Builderman and anybody he subconsciously allows 
  inside. This aura acts as a powerful shield, capable of nullifying any attack 
  before it can even reach targets inside.
- One Size Fits All: The Banhammer can automatically resize to fit Builderman's 
  needs, growing as large as a building or shrinking to the size of a bean on a 
  whim. Regardless of however large the hammer becomes, its weight does not 
  increase, nor does its power grow any weaker.
- Worthy Wielder: The Banhammer can be lifted by any Bloxian who tries, but only 
  Builderman is capable of activating the hammer's innate ability to erase matter. 
  Builderman is unsure if there are specific conditions to become "worthy" of the 
  hammer, or if it is exclusive to him.

                         BLOXXANNE WHELDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 35
Alignment: Lawful/Good
Ability: None

OVERVIEW:
Bloxxanne Whelder is Builderman's right hand and the Buildermen's head engineer. 
A passionate and energetic tinkerer, she finds joy in making the world a better 
place one invention at a time.

APPEARANCE:
Bloxxanne is a taller, slim-built Robloxian with ginger-colored hair. Her work 
uniform is primarily black and orange, consisting of a black undershirt and 
orange overalls. She wears a black hat with golden goggles featuring the 
Buildermen logo.

PERSONALITY:
Bloxxanne is a go-getter, full of energy and eager to please—especially her 
superiors. She prefers the solace of her workshop where she tinkers and invents. 
She can grow jealous when others outperform her, fearing she may be replaceable.

Builderman is far too smitten with Bloxxanne to consider replacing her, but 
she's oblivious to this, and he's too shy to speak up.

HISTORY:
Bloxxanne works as a head director for the Buildermen, responsible for much of 
their infrastructure including elevators and hydraulic security doors. She lives 
in a workshop within Buildermen Headquarters, constantly trying to outdo herself 
with each invention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            REN BYTERA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Noob
Age: 33
Alignment: Chaotic / Neutral
Ability: None (Uses augments and inventions)

OVERVIEW:
Ren is a brilliant yet morally questionable scientist whose experiments serve to 
assist her allies. She is jittery, overenergetic, and incredibly pushy when it 
comes to her scientific pursuits.

APPEARANCE:
Ren Bytera is a short and simple Noob, with black hair that has been messily 
bundled into pigtails. She wears a standard uniform for Bloxy Co-Operations' 
science division, along with multi-lens goggles that rest atop her head.

PERSONALITY:
Driven by innate curiosity and fascination with the Bloxiverse, Ren's insatiable 
appetite for knowledge often has her pushing boundaries and partaking in 
unethical experiments. Her obsession with science borders on psychopathic 
behavior. She holds no respect for life she experiments on and has no issues 
carrying out dangerous, cruel experiments.

AUGMENTS:

Biograft Blade:
Ren has a self-made augment, which she has implanted in her right wrist. 
Operating on the same biofuel her facility does, the augment allows Ren to 
project a green-tinted blade formed of pure plasma. This blade can effortlessly 
cut through some of the densest materials, vaporizing mostly anything it may 
come into contact with. Despite the power behind the Biograft Blade, Ren is far 
too inexperienced in combat to make use of it, limiting its potential. On top 
of this, Ren can very easily injure herself with an improper swing or body 
movement, so she'll often leave the weapon as an emergency resort. It also 
consumes large quantities of energy to remain active, quickly running out if Ren 
were to constantly keep it powered.

Ion Shielding:
Ren's chest is implanted with a chip enabling her to produce a 360° energy 
barrier at whatever angle she may need, protecting her from a majority of 
blunt-force or energy-based attacks. Ren can also project this shielding on 
other targets, though the shielding weakens in strength as Ren projects it on 
targets further away. The chip's battery can be depleted if the projected shield 
sustains enough damage, though it recharges naturally by seeping from Ren's 
body's energy. Ren must remain alert and aware of the charge remaining in her 
shield. Overuse can cause it to run out, leaving her defenceless. It also seeps 
away at her energy, which can quickly cause exhaustion as her body is drained of 
resources to power the augment. In severe cases, Ren may black out.

HISTORY:
Ren was originally a high-ranking researcher belonging to the Bloxy 
Co-Operatives, brought in for her outstanding IQ and love for science. Within 
this facility, new resources and products were brought in or created for the 
purpose of testing and eventual public release, and the experiments conducted 
were initially harmless. What started out as relatively harmless endeavors such 
as 'Would this ingredient be good for a new Bloxy Cola flavor?' or 'Is this new 
material better for producing cans?' quickly grew twisted and dark under Ren's 
supervision, her sadistic and dangerous curiosity shining through. 'How many 
toxic materials can we put in our products to save money?' and 'How much of 
this substance can we add to our product before it becomes a health risk?' were 
just some of the increasingly-sketchy questions Ren would seek to answer.

Eventually, Ren grew bored of using chemicals alone, and petitioned to use 
living Bloxians in her experiments. Ren had already established a presence 
within Bloxy Co-Operatives by this point, and the higher-ups were left in the 
dark on Ren's true nature. Naturally, they approved this request and started a 
campaign to bring in testing subjects, with promises of a handsome paycheck for 
their efforts. Naturally, the higher-ups would quickly come to regret this 
decision as Ren was quick to dive off of the deep end.

As the live experiments began, Ren was practically unable to contain her 
excitement. She'd have no hesitation testing the limits of Bloxian physiology, 
even though it had no apparent ties to Bloxy Co-Operatives nor their products. 
She'd test knowingly-toxic materials on Bloxians to see how much they can 
withstand before they die, she'd see how much of a Bloxian can be removed 
without them dying, and much worse. Other researchers in the field began to 
doubt and find a distaste for Ren's cruel curiosity, as she began to essentially 
torture the inflow of new subjects. The outrage among fellow scientists grew and 
grew, though they were powerless to stop her as she far outranked other members 
within the facility.

Eventually, tensions came to a head during Ren's final days under Bloxy 
Co-Operatives' science wing. Essentially, she had tried to produce a bomb that 
can only kill a Bloxian if they haven't consumed Bloxy Cola in the last 24 
hours. While Ren WAS successful in creating a bomb, it did not properly 
differentiate between those who did and didn't consume a Bloxy Cola. Multiple 
test subjects and staff were obliterated in the blast, and the facility was 
heavily damaged by the shockwave. Though Ren survived, she could no longer 
hide her operations from the higher-ups, as news of the facility's detonation 
spread like wildfire.

As news of the live experiments (and essentially torture) became public 
information, Bloxy Co-Operatives quickly begun damage control. Surviving 
employees were given severance pay and released under a contract to never speak 
of any events that took place within the facility. For a time, Ren was hunted 
down by Bloxy Co-Operatives through a paid contract issued to the Hunter 
Association. The search went on for quite some time, though it was eventually 
called off as Ren was nowhere to be found. In reality, Ren had hid within the 
ruins of the facility knowing that it would likely have been the last place 
they'd look, and she was correct to assume so.

From then on, Ren remained within a small radius of worlds surrounding the 
laboratory, repurposing the ruins into a discreet and spacious home for herself. 
She has remained undercover to this day, partially out of fear that she'll be 
found out by either Bloxy Co-Operatives or the public, as her face was made 
known to the masses. Bloxy Co-Operations has yet to salvage the building, 
preferring to keep away from their mess and save face after Ren's rampage 
damaged their reputation.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:

Nauli Parter - Friend:
Nauli was originally Ren's subject, as she had convinced Nauli to undergo an 
experimental surgery for Robux in return. Nauli underwent the procedure with no 
issues or adverse effects, and had psy-link antennae implanted in her head. 
Nauli was paid as promised, but the two ended up connecting throughout the 
experience. Nauli asked Ren questions and showed genuine interest in her work, 
which made Ren feel appreciated. The two opened up with one another, and ended 
up becoming friends. Ren and Nauli now regularly visit one another, and help 
each-other when in need. Ren is uncharacteristically friendly and respectful 
around Nauli, perhaps a sign of her gratefulness for Nauli's companionship.

Vortex A. Steele - Acquaintance:
Ren was introduced to Vortex through her connection to Nauli, and was 
commissioned to develop weapons for Vortex. As expected, Ren delivered and 
eventually produced the Mag-num and the Amplification Gauntlet, weapons that 
Vortex would go on to use many times. While Vortex and Ren never grew close, Ren 
was happy to see her work get put to good use and Vortex respected the 
craftsmanship that Ren had delivered upon.

Bloxxanne Whelder - Rival:
Ren has always been jealous of Bloxxanne's status and engineering skills, 
believing that she should be the one in Bloxxanne's place. She detests any 
mentioning of Bloxxanne or the Builder's Club, believing them to be far below 
her in intellect.

LIFESTYLE:
Ren burns her time away in a ruined laboratory, a Bloxy Co-Operatives research 
facility that has since gone defunct. Though the laboratory has long-since been 
abandoned, Ren's ingenuity and intelligence has allowed her to covert the remains 
of the facility into a remarkable base of operations and shelter for herself. 
The structure's abandoned status also allows her to lay low, keeping 
authoritarian figures and troublemakers unaware of her presence within the 
facility. As the days pass, Ren has had the time and resources to live a 
outstandingly luxurious life, especially for a Noob who is essentially squatting 
in a ruined lab. Growing her own veggies in a repurposed cafeteria, Ren keeps 
herself fed and healthy whilst old or extra supplies are processed with 
bio-processors, machines that generate electricity for the facility and its 
utilities. The once-packed sleeping quarters of the facility have been heavily 
remodeled by Ren, converting a space originally intended for up to 100 people 
into a grand bedroom exclusively for her. Ren is incredibly resourceful, and has 
put the abandoned machinery and technology left behind to good use. Curious at 
heart, Ren has constructed a wide array of inventions and tools through these 
abandoned resources, allowing her to participate in her "constructive" 
experiments. Ren has also developed an internal defense system, protecting her 
from threats who may breach into the facility, as well as any threats she may 
accidentally create during any of her unethical experiments.

================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           BRYCK MANNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 28
Alignment: Neutral / Evil
Ability: None (Uses Gravity Coil)

OVERVIEW:
Bryck Manning is a minor antagonist with a power complex, especially after 
coming into ownership of the Gravity Coil. He represents the dangers of 
unchecked power and the cycle of trauma.

APPEARANCE:
Bryck is a taller, slimmer Robloxian with shorter brown hair and stubble. He 
wears a green-and-black striped sweater with belted grey jeans. When using the 
Gravity Coil, he wraps it around his right arm.

PERSONALITY:
Without the Coil: Short-tempered, stubborn, and miserable. He despises being 
"just another civilian" born without special gifts. His hatred has left him as a 
broken man who seeks fulfillment by pushing others down.

With the Coil: Loses himself to his power complex. Becomes unstable, abusing the 
coil freely while remaining ignorant of those around him. His ego and sadistic 
nature shine through as he taunts and flaunts his power.

HISTORY:
Bryck Manning has lived a life shaped by misfortune and uncertainty. It's already 
common knowledge that the Bloxiverse is a dangerous place for many, but Bryck 
was truly dealt the shorter end of the stick in life. From birth, he was 
essentially always on the run. Each time he'd settle down and find a place he's 
happy with, some force of nature (or a Bloxian with sour intent) would quickly 
destroy whatever Bryck had managed to make for himself. This routine became 
commonplace for Bryck, much to his dismay. The severity and frequency of Bryck's 
assaults would suggest that they were targeted attacks, but this isn't the case. 
Unfortunately, he really is just unlucky.

Bryck has always sought a means to defend himself, some way to fight back 
against the cruelty. But as a mere powerless Bloxian, there was only so much he 
could do. Bryck tried exercising and excessive training at the gym, and while 
this did help—it was never enough. No amount of physical strength could truly 
best a Bloxian gifted with a powerful ability, and Bryck came to understand and 
despise this. Hatred and humiliation bubbled up internally each time he'd be set 
back by another attack, twisting his emotions and turning Bryck into a hateful 
and sadistic man.

Of course, this vicious cycle could only last for so long, and Bryck's life 
would finally hit a turning point. Late at night, Bryck was wandering aimlessly 
after a recent attack had evaporated his home into dust. Cursing to himself, he 
took out his frustration on an empty can of Bloxy Cola, as he kicked it around 
the empty street. But something caught his attention—a glimmer of blue in the 
moonlight, off in the bushes. Thinking it to potentially be something of value, 
he approached the bush and pulled out the object. Lo and behold, Bryck was 
bewildered to have unearthed an artifact, one of legend. Bryck had encountered 
the Gravity Coil.

As a natural skeptic, he first believed it to be a fake, or some cruel joke 
planted by a prankster. The Power Coils had been spoken about in many of the 
history books, what could something so important possibly be doing here? He kept 
these thoughts in mind and kept his expectations low, and slipped it on his arm. 
But, no... this was no fake. The coil shifted to fit his arm and locked into 
place, producing a sound that he could only describe as clicking. Calming 
himself, he tried to trigger the effects of the coil. Nothing happened at first, 
and it took a bit of trial and error as Bryck flailed and leapt around like an 
idiot, expecting the coil to work automatically. But he soon came to understand 
that it took his subconscious will rather than physical action, and for the 
first time Bryck successfully managed to trigger the coil and hover.

It was a cascading spiral for Bryck from that moment on, as he began to 
experiment and test the limits of his own body, as well as the coil's power. The 
more he used it, the more his sadistic nature began to shine. His experiments 
began as harmless tests at first—seeing how high he could jump or what amount of 
intensified gravity he could tolerate. But as things progressed, he began to test 
the potential it held for combat, destroying infrastructure or attacking 
innocents. His power complex took hold and grew as Bryck continued to use the 
coil, eventually becoming consumed by the power. His original desires for a way 
to protect himself grew twisted into sadistic revenge, leading Bryck to become 
the very thing he swore against. He finally had a way to settle down in a home, 
one he could valiantly protect—but no. That wasn't enough anymore, he had the 
power he needed and it was time to show off just what he was capable of. The 
consequences of generational trauma have been realized through Bryck's behavior 
and actions.

He was eventually defeated by Caesar and Nauli during his rampage at the Farmer 
Sanctuary. Now imprisoned by the Hunter Association, he works as a laborer while 
receiving therapy. His vengeance against Caesar burns bright.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          CHARLES STUDSON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 22
Alignment: Lawful/Neutral
Ability: Chainipulation

OVERVIEW:
Charles is a sharp, short-fused elite operative for the Hunter Association, 
ranking as the third-best bounty hunter. He is Vortex's main rival.

APPEARANCE:
Charles has medium-length messy silver hair. His hunting uniform includes a 
black leather overcoat with metal plating, chainmail protection for chest and 
arms, and a carbon-fiber mask protecting his lower jaw.

PERSONALITY:
Charles is sharp and short-fused, quick to anger when provoked. He's loud, 
egotistical, and self-centered, almost always operating independently because he 
believes others drag him down.

Beneath his aggressive exterior, Charles suffers from depressive episodes and 
loneliness. He pushes meaningful connections away to maintain his public image, 
believing closeness would put both himself and others at risk.

ABILITY - CHAINIPULATION:
Charles has the power of Chainipulation, the ability to summon and manipulate 
chains from his body and a local area around himself. These chains have 
incredible tenacity and precision, making them versatile tools for Charles to 
take advantage of when in combat. They function as grappling hooks, whips, armor, 
extra limbs, restraints, and much more. The chains aren't made from nothing, of 
course — Charles uses the iron in his blood to create the chains, meaning he 
can quickly exhaust himself if he overworks his chain generation.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:

Vortex A. Steele - Rival/Superior:
Charles's main opposition within the Hunter Association. They endlessly compete 
for 2nd place in the rankings, yet Vortex consistently stays one step ahead. 
Despite the rivalry infuriating him, Charles uses this rage against Vortex as 
motivation to improve. He secretly admires Vortex, though he'd never admit it.

Bryck Manning - Ally:
Though the two aren't close in any respect, they've spent time together in the 
Hunter Association's holding facility, where the two grew to be partners in 
their work. They've also bonded over the distaste they share for Caesar, Nauli, 
and Vortex. It was through Bryck's connection to Charles that a Hunter 
Association contract could be made against Caesar, despite Bryck being in the 
Hunter Association's prison.

LIFESTYLE:
Charles is an elite operative for the Hunter Association, ranking the third best 
bounty hunter of the Hunters. He has proven himself and his worth countless 
times, through a variety of contracts and covert missions given to him by the 
H.A. To accommodate him and his prestigious ranking, the H.A has provided 
Charles with a master's suite, located directly within the H.A's headquarters. 
He has the life that some Bloxians could only dream of, provided with all of the 
food, resources, and entertainment a Bloxian could ever need, and more. Charles 
gets through his day by relying on the praise and rushes of dopamine he gets 
through his completed contracts and rank-climbing, effectively living to serve 
the H.A and establish a name for himself. Each day brings new trials and 
tribulations for Charles, and he finds the thrills of hunting to be 
exhilarating, helping to numb his depression as well. Besides, it's hard to 
think about how upset you're feeling in the middle of an intense fight, or when 
you're out lurking for your next bounty to claim. Although Charles lives 
directly within the H.A's headquarters — a place full of other hunters and 
social gatherings, mind you — he has never been much for socializing. Most of 
the other residents fear him as some hardened hitman, while others envy his 
position and go out of their way to spitefully ignore him. Even so, Charles 
doesn't see the point in making friends, as most hunters won't last long and 
are quick to perish in such a gruesome line of work. He knows that it would only 
hurt him more if he opened up and got attached. When Charles isn't on a 
contract, he often wastes away in his suite. He has no hobbies, no 
extracurricular activities, or anything of the sort. He prefers to doom-scroll 
on his phone, or spend his time playing video games. Charles can find himself 
lost on his phone for hours, sometimes — especially so if no new contracts come 
to pull him out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           THE BOUNCEMAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian (Modified)
Age: Unknown
Alignment: Rebel/Impure
Role: Marauder
Ability: Atomic Trampoline (Internal Device)

OVERVIEW:
The Bounceman is a crazed rubber ball who forces unwilling participants into an 
impossible training regimen, often leading to their death. Originally a simple 
office worker named Boris Dohm, he was horrifically transformed through 
experiments conducted by Rovan Macov.

APPEARANCE:
The Bounceman is a short, rotund Robloxian with no arms or legs. He has white 
skin with a red-rubber body and white-rubber bottom. He wears a tailored trench 
coat with flared collar. He has large, bulbous eyes with no visible mouth and is 
entirely bald, though often wears a top hat.

ORIGIN - BORIS DOHM:

Boris Dohm:
Far before the Bounceman's own existence was a man by the name of Boris Dohm. 
Boris was a simple and ordinary man, a fan of tailoring and exercise. He worked 
an office job within the Roblox World Headquarters, positioned as an intern 
within one of their many offices. His life was easy and honest, though 
admittedly it was one of mediocrity. Despite how plain it all was, Boris felt 
no desires for change or more in his life. He knew he had it better than most 
others did, and he felt peace knowing that he was, at the very least, in a 
secure position in life. He may have settled for simplicity, but he cherished 
it all nonetheless. Boris was happy.

The Accident:
Yet another day arrived at the office, one like any other. Boris sat at his 
desk, ruffling through pages and organizing documents when a member of management 
approached him, leaning onto his desk. Boris was a bit nervous, but the manager 
reassured him that he only wanted a favor. He asked Boris to go on a large coffee 
run for the employees on his floor. Boris agreed, hoping to seize the 
opportunity for a chance to slack off. Boris swiped the company card from its 
holder on the wall, heading out of the building as he took a breath of fresh air 
and had a big stretch. He left the confines of the World and entered the Miasma, 
setting off for the Starblox that wasn't too far away. The Miasma was noticeably 
empty, but Boris paid it no mind.

Boris loved being the designated coffee-man for his co-workers, surprised that 
people weren't competing for the position. Sitting down for those long hours, 
sorting through those documents... It eats away at the mind after a while. An 
opportunity to get out and have time to yourself whilst still being paid? It was 
a no-brainer decision in Boris' eyes. He always wished he could've landed a more 
active job, one that kept him moving around and working hard. He also wouldn't 
have minded being a tailor, seeing as he regularly practiced his own 
clothesmaking in his spare time.

Boris put these thoughts aside as he neared the Starblox. Suddenly, a World 
nearby violently erupted into a flash of electricity, before shattering and 
scattering debris in every direction. Boris had enough time to react but was left 
with no means to defend himself, allowing a large chunk of debris to tear 
completely through most of his torso. He immediately began to lose consciousness 
as he was blasted back, his last conscious thoughts lingering on wishing he 
could've done more with his life. As the company phone flew away, the embedded 
security measures within had activated from the impact, dialing emergency 
services who quickly closed in on Boris' location. Despite the odds, Boris' 
unconscious body was recovered and successfully stabilized after multiple 
surgeries and a plethora of medications. Although he survived the incident, he 
was left completely comatose and entirely unresponsive. Members of his family 
frequently visited him, caring for him by changing his clothing and stretching 
his body. This was a routine that would continue on for many months, but Boris' 
condition only seemed to grow more bleak as time went on.

A New Hope:
Soon enough, the hospital housing Boris provided his caregivers with an 
ultimatum—Let Boris continue to fight a losing battle, or pull the plug on his 
life support and end his suffering. His family initially protested the idea, but 
the hospital soon convinced them that it was simply in Boris' best interests. A 
heap of paperwork was completed for the scheduled plug-pull, something he 
would've happily done given the experience at his job. Eventually, days had 
passed and the time arrived where Boris would be put to rest for good. His 
mother was the one who would do it, given a final chance to say goodbye to her 
son. Her hand gripped the plug, trembling with a mix of sorrow, anger, and 
hesitation. Right as she gathered the resolve to rip the cord from the wall, a 
man burst through the door and yelled for her to stop. The shock made her release 
the cord instantly, turning towards the voice. The man introduced himself as 
Rovan, explaining that he was a master of bioengineering. He explained his work, 
and that he believed that Boris could be saved—Not with medicine, but by being 
rebuilt. His family was suspicious, but Boris' mother quickly folded under the 
pressure. She'd rather have taken a chance to save Boris than to end his life 
herself. More paperwork was signed, passing the rights Boris' family had over him 
onto Rovan, who happily took Boris away with the promise that he would live on 
once again. They were left with a contact card to reach out, and stay in touch 
with the process. With a nod and wave goodbye, Rovan wheeled Boris out after his 
life support system was transferred to a portable unit. This would be the last 
time Boris' family would ever see or hear of him.

The Experiment:
Arriving back at Rovan's facility, Boris was roughly thrown onto the operating 
table, as a sinister smile crept across Rovan's face. Those fools had signed off 
their rights to Boris, freeing him of any legal complications. They had even 
bought the fake contact card, what a joke! Rovan laughed to himself, as he 
prepared his tools for the surgeries and experiments that would soon follow. 
Though he had no plans to return Boris to his family, Rovan was not entirely 
lying about his promise to awaken Boris—He would do so, no matter the cost. He 
would awaken Boris once again, through the lens of Rovan's sickened visions.

Rovan wasted no time and immediately got to work, dissecting parts of Boris that 
he believed weren't needed. His limbs had already been damaged by the accident, 
they were just dead weight and obviously had to go. His hair got in the way of 
brain surgeries, so his scalp was lightly cooked by a laser to permanently be 
rid Boris of hair. Boris was cut open and had a majority of his organs replaced 
with mechanical components, pieces that were much more efficient than their 
organic counterparts. Boris had his body heavily morphed and reshaped to fit the 
new components and structure of his body. A special skeleton was implanted to 
retain a rounded shape, as his skull was compressed into his chest to complete 
the spherical appearance. His eyes were gouged and reattached to the surface of 
his face.

Rovan realized that if Boris woke up, he'd have no way to do much of anything—Especially 
not move, and that simply wouldn't do. Beyond his face, Boris was skinned and 
had a specialized rubber replace the surface of his body. Boris was cut open 
once again, as a device known as the Atomic Trampoline was installed; This 
granted Boris the ability to aim and bounce himself freely. The clothing Boris 
originally wore was reattached and embedded within the rubber, as Rovan found the 
charm of Boris' coat to fit the new body nicely.

Eventually, it came time to relocate Boris' brain deeper into his chest cavity. 
Rovan had previously compressed the skull down to a flat surface, something he 
believed may have damaged the brain. He carefully cut open Boris, one last time. 
He sliced his brain from his skull, carefully replanting it into a specialized 
compartment within Boris' chest. A nanosurgical device was used to attach 
individual nerves and brain cells back to the brain stem, though this was not 
done with guaranteed accuracy. Small connections were likely missed, and some 
connections were probably made incorrectly. Rovan had no choice but to look past 
these marginal errors, as they were problems not even he could fix.

After weeks of work and perfecting Boris' new form, it finally came time to wake 
the new man up. Electricity and adrenaline was pumped into his body en-masse, 
shocking Boris' body to life. Such a method was harsh, but Rovan believed that 
it would be extremely difficult to wake someone up, especially if they had 
been altered to such an extreme degree like Boris. He trusted his methods and he 
was right to do so, as Boris' eyes shot open for the first time in months. Rovan 
had succeeded in awakening Boris.

The Reawakening:
Exhausted and clouded by a broken mind, Boris looked around blankly as he came to 
his senses. He scanned the room with his tired eyes, looking down at his own 
body and learning of the horrible changes Rovan had made. Yet, despite the 
severity of the things Rovan had done, Boris did not scream or cry. His deadpan 
expression confused even Rovan, who hypothesized that he may have improperly 
reconnected Boris' brain. Despite the obvious mental struggle, Rovan decided to 
attempt a conversation with Boris. Though just as he went to speak, Boris rolled 
off of the table, bouncing into a nearby wall. His expression, though hard to 
read, suggested he was lost in thought.

Deep in Boris' mind, he thought deeply in a desperate effort to cling to whatever 
memories he could. He remembered his job, being at work and getting asked to do a 
favor by a coworker. What WAS the favor? It was to grab something, perhaps papers? 
No, it was coffee—Boris had left to get coffee. His thoughts spiraled as his 
memories came flooding back, and eventually he recalled the injury, alongside the 
last moments of regret he felt; The feelings he carried before what he believed 
would be his death. He let out a cry of rage and sorrow, screaming from the 
slurry of emotion that came pouring into his heart. His mind twisted as his 
senses returned, fully grasping the situation he now found himself within.

Rovan realized that Boris' condition was growing unstable, but it was already too 
late—The raw emotion Boris felt was enough to trigger the Atomic Trampoline that 
Rovan had installed, causing Boris to violently bounce against the walls, his 
momentum increasing as it put strain on the facility's structure. With a final 
yell, Boris breached the armored walls and shot out of the World he was 
contained within, straight into the Miasma. He launched from World to World, 
confused and scared. His thoughts were racing as they slowly drained away from 
his mind, eventually calming down as he came to a slow float within the cosmic 
nothingness.

The Bounceman:
As Boris came to a standstill, he had a moment alone to truly process and 
understand what had happened. He wept at the situation, for a reason his hazy 
mind struggled to comprehend. The last thoughts he had as a normal Bloxian were 
all that he was left with, his dreams to do more in life, to train and become a 
masterful tailor... But, wait. Just then, he was soaring through the Bloxiverse 
at speeds he once only could've dreamed of! His coat he made was still attached, 
too! Say, perhaps this new situation he found himself in was not one of sadness 
and shamefulness, but rather a blessing in disguise?

In his twisted euphoria, Boris let go of his old life and fully submerged himself 
into this new headspace. The joy he felt was unimaginable, he was free to go 
where he pleased and act however he wished. Why weren't others the way he was? 
Why did they settle for such mediocrity, when they too could be free? Boris' own 
mind left for the back seat, as a new persona set in. He desired to share the 
euphoric feelings he felt as a free man, and set off on a quest to train others 
to attain the same status he did—despite being completely unaware of how he'd 
ended up the way he did in the first place.

Boris (a name he no longer recalled) went on to become a notoriously-known 
Bloxian, said to force his victims into a twisted training regimen. He'll insist 
that if you try hard enough, then you too can reach his status. The regimen 
itself is impossible to complete... At least, if you aren't a hyper-buoyant 
rubber sphere. This causes his unwilling participants to inevitably fall short 
of his expectations. When they do, they're either forced to try again, or 
beaten senselessly as a form of motivation—A process that inevitably leads to 
the death of his targets. Nobody knows where he came from, or why he does what 
it is he does. But he has had the time to amass a reputation and earn a name for 
himself, one that strikes fear when told around a campfire late at night—A 
crazed rubber ball, known as the Bounceman.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:

Rovan Macov - Partial Creator:
Rovan Macov is a lunatic, as well as the biomechanical engineer responsible for 
the creation of the Bounceman. As a normal Bloxian, Boris never knew Rovan as 
they only met long after Boris had gone comatose. Although, as the Bounceman, 
the two had interacted with one-another for mere minutes, before he escaped from 
the facility Rovan held him in. It is undetermined whether the Bounceman is 
aware of what Rovan did to him, though it would appear he holds no ill intent 
towards Rovan if so. He'd probably treat Rovan as he does with other Bloxians, 
attempting to grant them the same freedom Rovan had oh-so-generously awakened in 
him.

LIFESTYLE:

Alone:
The Bounceman leads a one-track lifestyle, only seeking to stay moving and 
bouncing around through his rubbery body. He believes that sharing the joys of 
exercise is his express purpose, happily displaying his devotion to motion to any 
unfortunate victims who may be nearby. As the Bounceman lacks any limbs, there 
are very few hobbies he could truly participate in—even with a clear and sane 
mind. But even then; in his eyes, those extra activities would be silly! After 
all, why sit down when you could keep on moving? He'll make sure they understand 
this, whether they like it or not.

Victims:
Out and about within the Bloxiverse, the Bounceman springs from one World to the 
next, all in search of 'lucky ones' to share the joys of movement with. Once he 
has his eyes set on a victim, little can be done to stop him. His smaller form 
and rubberized body allow him to catch up to the most elusive of Bloxians, with 
relatively no effort required. He'll wear his target down until he can force 
them to exercise along with him, often demanding his victims to complete feats 
that only the Bounceman is realistically capable of. When they inevitably fail to 
meet his expectations, they'll be forced to try again and get senselessly beaten 
when they cannot any longer. It is undetermined whether the Bounceman's training 
regimen is made to be sadistic (and/or purposefully impossible) in nature, or if 
it was truly made for some innocent (and deluded) fun. Regardless of the intent, 
crossing paths with the Bounceman is never a good idea.

COMBAT:

The Bounceman relies on an internal device known as the Atomic Trampoline to 
remain incredibly bouncy and mobile while in combat. He'll slam into his targets 
at incredibly lethal velocities, beating his victims into submission and their 
eventual death. He is mostly immune to physical weaponry, mainly due to his 
unique body structure. Most of his body is protected by a thick rubbery 
material, while his bones have been cast into a metal skeleton. While puncturing 
him with sharp weapons is possible, the ultra-dense rubber seals most wounds 
immediately.

Key Techniques:
- Atomic Trampoline: The Bounceman is implanted with a powerful device known as 
  the Atomic Trampoline, allowing him to subconsciously alter his density and 
  buoyancy on a whim. Combined with his rubbery body, the Bounceman can quickly 
  accelerate and reach lethal speeds, allowing him to quickly move from place to 
  place and tear through some of the toughest materials. So long as he remains 
  denser than the object he strikes, he'll often punch a hole completely 
  through. Given enough time and with a strong enough kinetic force, the 
  Bounceman can become an unpredictable projectile, capable of travelling speeds 
  that appear blurry to the naked eye. Although the Bounceman could theoretically 
  accelerate to infinity, his body and mind can only sustain a limited amount of 
  force. He does not possess enhanced reaction speeds beyond that of an average 
  Bloxian, meaning he becomes significantly more inaccurate as he speeds up. He 
  can comfortably push himself to the speed of sound, but going beyond this 
  often begins to stretch and warp his rubbery body, putting strain on both the 
  Atomic Trampoline and the metal skeleton sustaining his rounded shape. 
  Sustaining such speeds are bound to cause internal injuries, and may even 
  break his skeleton.
- Rubbery Skin: The Bounceman has had a majority of his skin replaced with 
  specialized rubber, a material designed to work in tandem with the Atomic 
  Trampoline installed within the Bounceman's torso. It is classified as 
  'ultra-dense', capable of withstanding incredible velocities and severe impacts 
  without warping or otherwise losing form. It is tough to penetrate, and wounds 
  quickly close up as the pressure seals open holes almost immediately. Pushing 
  his speeds to the limit may damage the rubber, as although it is extremely 
  durable, all natural elements have a limit as to what they can sustain. 
  Speeds beyond the speed of sound will contort his body further and further, 
  eventually ripping the rubber away.
- Iron Gut: The Bounceman's skeleton is entirely metal, meshed into a spherical 
  form designed to maintain his rounded appearance. Additionally, all of the 
  Bounceman's organs (everything beyond his brain, eyes, and the skin on his 
  face) have been replaced by their mechanical counterparts and rubber, providing 
  a wide range of benefits: He requires exclusively water to sustain himself, 
  meaning he cannot starve. Most of his mechanical organs charge with kinetic 
  force, similarly to the weaponry used by Vortex. As long as he remains on the 
  move, he'll always stay healthy. His mechanical organs work autonomously from 
  his brain, meaning he loses energy extremely slowly. He rarely needs to sleep 
  as a result, almost always remaining on the move. Of course, this is excluding 
  the occasional power nap. It is nearly impossible to poison or otherwise 
  inflict him with any similar status conditions. Standard needles and darts 
  struggle to penetrate the rubber of his skin, let alone the metallic skeleton 
  and organs kept within—Unless directly injected into his brain through the 
  skin on his face. Though mostly, the only reliable way to inflict the 
  Bounceman with a condition is to use gas, as he still requires air to breathe.

Offensive Techniques:
- Kinetic Ricochet: The Bounceman can senselessly ram into his targets, rapidly 
  firing himself off of the walls to increase his momentum. Targets can quickly 
  become overwhelmed by his high speeds and rapid attacks, often collapsing to 
  the ground from a barrage of rough slams. These attacks do not let up until 
  the Bounceman believes he has thoroughly beaten his target into submission, or 
  if the target can escape or relocate to an area with fewer surfaces to bounce 
  off of. This style of attack is highly efficient in close-quarters combat, 
  especially within buildings or other enclosed spaces. It quickly drops in power 
  as the battlefield becomes more spacious, eventually becoming ineffective in 
  entirely flat clearings.
- Rubber Riposte: The Bounceman can use the momentum carried within the physical 
  attacks of his enemies, using it as means to speed himself up. In doing so, he 
  can retaliate with a strike at nearly the exact moment he is struck, catching 
  most of his opponents off-guard. This technique works better when the Bounceman 
  is struck by heavier, blunt attacks—Such as those issued from sledgehammers or 
  metal bats. Like with most of the Bounceman's methods for combat, this 
  technique relies heavily on close-quarters combat with lots of nearby surfaces 
  to ricochet off of. Open fields prevent the Bounceman from properly performing 
  a ricochet towards his opponent.
- Or-ball-tal Strike: When no surfaces are nearby for the Bounceman to ricochet 
  off of, he can leap high into the air and crash down at significant speeds. This 
  essentially turns him into a mini-meteorite, moving towards the ground at a 
  speed that causes the air nearby to ignite from the friction. Depending on 
  what he crashes into and at what speed he is travelling, there is often a 
  small explosion as Bounceman makes contact with the floor. This technique can 
  be repeated rapidly, allowing him to cover large areas with a barrage of 
  strikes into the earth and his targets. This technique works, so long as 
  Bounceman does not become lodged into the ground or another material he cannot 
  ricochet off of, such as water.

Defensive Techniques:
- Immovable Object: By greatly amplifying his density, the Bounceman can lock 
  his position in place. In doing so, he becomes almost impossible to move 
  without extreme amounts of force, or some form of ability that can alter the 
  weight of targets. This technique is incredibly useful against strong forces, 
  such as winds and powerful impacts that would normally send the Bounceman 
  flying. Naturally, the downside to this technique is that the Bounceman becomes 
  completely immobile while it is active. It also takes a few moments to revert 
  the density changes afterwards.

Utilitarian Techniques:
- Bouncing Around: Naturally, the Bounceman has no issues travelling across the 
  Bloxiverse or covering large distances relatively fast. By building up enough 
  momentum—Enough to move quickly but not too much to give him no reaction 
  time—He can effectively go anywhere he pleases. Inter-World travel is 
  trivialized by his impressive speeds, and most opponents stand no chance if 
  they attempt to flee.

Drawbacks:
- Think Fast: High speeds make the Bounceman incredibly deadly, yet his mind 
  often struggles to keep up with the impossible speeds his artificial body can 
  reach. His reaction time is not enhanced as his brain (although damaged) 
  remains unaltered, despite the countless surgeries. He can opt to wildly 
  ricochet off of surfaces at the speed of sound if he so chooses, but he is 
  entirely incapable of aiming or properly planning his next moves while doing 
  so.
- Rollin' Limbless: Obviously, the Bounceman lacks any arms or legs. Therefore, 
  he struggles to do basically anything that would normally require hands or 
  legs. He cannot sprint, use conventional weaponry, or do much of anything. If he 
  were to somehow be restrained or have his Atomic Trampoline deactivated, he 
  would be left entirely helpless and at the mercy of others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           THE RECKONER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: N/A (Host-Dependent)
Age: N/A (Host-Dependent)
Alignment: Chaotic/Evil
Ability: The Reckoning

OVERVIEW:
The Reckoner is the bringer of end times, an unfathomably powerful entity 
created with the sole purpose of ending reality itself. It exists as a spirit 
without a tangible form of its own, requiring hosts to utilize its power.

APPEARANCE:
Formless: A mass of energy shaped like a Bloxian, with energy rapidly swirling 
and jittering erratically.

When possessing a host, the host's skin turns sickly white and features become 
corrupted with black and red accents. The host gains an unending, malevolent 
grin.

PERSONALITY:
The Reckoner has no personality, feelings, or opinions beyond its sole purpose 
of resetting the Bloxiverse. It does nothing but smile, ignorant of the 
atrocities it commits.

ABILITY - THE RECKONING:
- Crimson energy that rots organic and inorganic material on contact
- Radiating aura causes fatal health issues within approximately 17 miles
- Energy projectiles cut through any material
- "Eternal wounding" prevents natural healing of wounds struck by the Reckoner
- Incredible physical strength and speed far exceeding the best fighters
- Nearly unstoppable once it begins its march

HISTORY:
The Reckoner was born from an occult operated by 1x1x1x1, who desired a reset of 
the Bloxiverse. When unleashed, Builderman became its first host. Roblox 
intervened, capturing the Reckoner within the R-Orb and restoring Builderman.

The R-Orb lures Bloxians toward it, and several hosts have been possessed over 
time. Roblox eventually buried the R-Orb in the farthest reaches of the 
Bloxiverse before disappearing. Builderman later rediscovered it and became its 
sworn defender.

================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              ROBLOX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Unknown (Creator Deity)
Status: Missing/Unknown

Roblox is the creator deity who brought the Bloxiverse into existence. They 
created the Heart to power reality, the three Bloxian races (Guests, Noobs, 
Robloxians), and various divine artifacts and entities.

Roblox disappeared after creating the Robloxians. Their fate is unknown—many 
believe them to be deceased or imprisoned. Before disappearing, Roblox buried 
the R-Orb containing the Reckoner in the farthest reaches of the Bloxiverse.

KEY CREATIONS:
- The Bloxiverse and the Heart
- The three Bloxian races
- Builderman's powers and the Banhammer
- The Gravity Coil and Speed Coil
- Spawnboy and the Edge
- The R-Orb (to contain the Reckoner)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             SPAWNBOY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Bloxian (Unidentified Species)
Age: Primordial (Timeless Entity)
Alignment: True Neutral
Ability: Spawnipulation

OVERVIEW:
Spawnboy is a divine entity created by Roblox to watch over and lead the souls 
of the fallen to their eternal resting place within the Edge. They are the 
Bloxiverse's grim reaper.

APPEARANCE:
Spawnboy is of average height with a completely greyscale palette. Multiple 
Sunspawn sigils mark their body and dark robes. A Sunspawn sigil is plastered on 
their face around a singular white eye. Two halos hover above their head.

PERSONALITY:
Quiet, reserved, and lacking understanding of Bloxian emotions. Despite their 
cold persona, Spawnboy is friendly and considerate, understanding that most 
souls they interact with need comfort. They respect boundaries and have keen 
emotional intelligence.

The emotional dampening is necessary for absolute neutrality—good and evil are 
treated equally when their time to pass comes.

ABILITY - SPAWNIPULATION:
Spawnboy was bestowed with the ability to fully manipulate the forces of both 
life and death, a tool given to them by Roblox to aid with their sworn duty as 
the Bloxiverse's reaper. It is white in color, akin to the souls it was made 
for processing. It manifests in the form of white sparkles and glowing Sunspawn 
sigils.

OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES:
Theoretically, Spawnipulation enables Spawnboy to instantly reap the soul of a 
target, regardless of distance or other factors that could possibly hinder the 
effects. If desired, Spawnboy could generate hostile lifeforms for combat on a 
whim, or dismantle opposing lifeforms by reaping their souls within an instant. 
Of course, Spawnboy is more than responsible with Spawnipulation and would never 
waste or misuse it. Dramatic flare is unnecessary when a mere wave of the hand 
will suffice.

DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES:
Spawnipulation doesn't provide any directly-defensive abilities to Spawnboy, as 
it was created to be used exclusively on others. Spawnboy's primary line of 
defense lies within his own physical potential and controlled intangibility.

UTILITARIAN CAPABILITIES:
Spawnipulation is a straightforward ability and doesn't have many "daily life" 
benefits, as it wasn't created with a typical life in mind. However, it 
technically has the potential to heal any wound or restore health to any 
individual whatsoever, regardless of their current condition—even if every atom 
of an individual is completely gone. Naturally, even knowing they could give 
eternal youth and health to anybody they choose, that would be misuse of 
Spawnipulation as that isn't what the power was made for, and Spawnboy could 
never do such a thing.

LIMITATIONS:
While all of the aforementioned abilities and qualities of Spawnipulation are 
true, these powers do not function outside of the Edge. While in a theoretical 
situation, Spawnipulation COULD affect living beings, its influence is incapable 
of travelling between dimensions. As Spawnboy is bound to the Edge, it 
essentially means his godlike abilities can only affect those who have already 
died, or are in the process of dying.

EQUIPMENT:

The Respawner:
The Respawner is a powerful, two-handled chakram-blade hybrid that Spawnboy was 
provided with by Roblox to aid in their duties as a reaper. The blades appear 
inseparable, hovering closely together as their circular bodies form the design 
of a Sunspawn sigil. It appears to be forged from an unknown (and likely-anomalous) 
metal, theorized by many to be Bloxite. The Respawner can be used to instantly 
obliterate the lifeforce of a Bloxian, down to their very soul when contact with 
the weapon is made. While the Respawner is capable of wounding others through its 
incredibly sharp body or fine edges, a mere tap of the blade against a target 
will cause the Respawner's ability to take effect.

HISTORY:
Spawnboy is a primordial deity that predates nearly every Bloxian, even the 
coveted race of Guests. They were created alongside the Bloxiverse by Roblox, 
though they were quickly separated as Spawnboy would find themselves in the 
Edge, a limbo-esque dimension created exclusively for Spawnboy and the deceased. 
Spawnboy was assigned the sacred duty of handling the forces of life and death, 
represented through the black and white colors present within the Sunspawn sigil 
that was engraved within their mind and body. Spawnboy has served their purpose 
for unfathomable lengths of time, their loyalty to Roblox unwavering and true. 
Though despite eons of existence, Spawnboy has never been able to visit the 
Bloxiverse, as their presence and energy is bound to the Edge. Roblox placed this 
caveat upon Spawnboy not without purpose, as bringing the manifestation of life 
and death into a physical reality is bound to cause extinction-level events. 
Though Spawnboy wishes to someday see the Bloxiverse in person, they've always 
been perfectly content. Over the years, they've learned bits and pieces of what 
a real life is like, through the experiences shared to them by the souls they've 
put to rest.

RELATIONSHIPS:
Due to the nature of Spawnboy's existence and purpose, forming meaningful or 
long-lasting connections is impossible. As of now, they have no family or friends 
they could possibly recall.

================================================================================
                      PART VII: LEGENDARY ARTIFACTS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           THE BANHAMMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Divine Weapon
Owner: Builderman
Creator: Roblox

DESCRIPTION:
The Banhammer is a divine weapon, created by Roblox and directly imbued with a 
portion of his own power. It was created for Builderman in particular, who is 
also the only known Bloxian capable of activating the divine powers within. It 
was made to be an ultimate authority within the Bloxiverse, striking down evil 
in just one swing. The Banhammer is revered by many as the strongest weapon in 
the Bloxiverse, believed by some to even be the strongest thing in existence 
outright.

APPEARANCE:

Deactivated:
The Banhammer is a cobalt-colored, top-heavy warhammer with black-ribbed lines 
skewing in and outwards. A large leather handle runs up, connecting into a 
metal-studded brace which wraps around the center of the Banhammer's head. As 
the Banhammer has the innate ability to adjust its size, it is never 
consistently seen at one specific height or width.

Activated:
While activated by a wielder capable of channeling the power within, the 
Banhammer ignites into an aura of holy radiance and fire. This aura shines 
brightly, growing in size and intensity as the desires of the user become 
stronger.

FUNCTIONALITY:
The Banhammer carries a fraction of Roblox's own power, granting it a divine 
status and an unfathomably lethal ability. With just a single swing, anything 
can be completely erased from the Bloxiverse—this is regardless of the target's 
mass or defenses. Erasing something with the Banhammer does not require a 
powerful swing, but rather it depends on the wielder's intent to erase what they 
strike. Even a tap to the forehead would be sufficient enough for the 
Banhammer's erasure to trigger; it all depends on the desires of the holder. 
Only a small handful of matter is immune to the Banhammer's effects, primarily 
gasses and raw energy, as they almost never have a solidified point for the 
Banhammer to make contact with.

TIMELINE:

The Forging:
Back during the earliest years of the Bloxiverse, Builderman was chosen to 
become a guardian for the Bloxiverse and assist Roblox directly in its 
development. Roblox feared that Builderman may receive backlash for being placed 
above others, so he decided to bestow Builderman with an ultimate tool, one he 
could use to defend himself. He sacrificed a portion of his energy to create this 
tool, eventually giving way to the creation of the Banhammer. Eventually, Roblox 
presented Builderman with the Banhammer, a tool he could use to both channel the 
gift of creation, and eradicate those who stood in his way. Builderman was 
hesitant to accept the hammer at first, against the idea of authority through 
violence. Roblox reassured him that he didn't have to use it to reign authority 
over others, and that it was purely a tool for self-defense. This mindset allowed 
Builderman to warm up to the Banhammer, accepting Roblox's gift and becoming the 
sole wielder of the hammer.

Modern Day:
Builderman remains the only user of the Banhammer, holding it just as near and 
dear as he did the day he received it. It has remained visually unchanged, with 
no signs of wear to be seen—perhaps partially due to Builderman's aversion to 
using it. There have been a handful of incidents involving the theft of the 
Banhammer, but no Bloxian could keep the hammer for long without becoming a large 
target themselves. In the end, it has always found its way back to Builderman, 
the Bloxian it was made to be with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        THE COILS OF POWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collection of three legendary coils, each capable of manipulating a different 
natural law. Only one copy of each exists.

THE GRAVITY COIL
----------------
Color: Sky-blue with white specks
Creator: Roblox
Current Status: In possession of Ren Bytera (kept discreet, unused)

APPEARANCE:
The Gravity Coil is a large metallic spring, sky-blue in color with specks of 
white scattered across its surface. It is cold and rough to the touch, similar 
to rusted metal. Despite its appearance, the Gravity Coil is extremely malleable 
and bends with ease. Though it most commonly takes the form of a spring, its 
length and shape can freely reform to wrap around nearly any limb or object.

DESCRIPTION:
The Gravity Coil is a divine artifact and one of the three Power Coils 
belonging to the Coils of Power. Like the others, it is formed from Activated 
Bloxite, rendering it effectively indestructible and impossible to recreate. 
Each Power Coil governs one of the three fundamental laws of reality, and the 
Gravity Coil is responsible for the manipulation of gravity itself.

FUNCTIONALITY:
The Gravity Coil can be wrapped around the limb of a Bloxian, granting them the 
innate ability to manipulate gravitational forces. This is achieved by 
channeling the law of gravity directly into the wearer's body, binding its 
control to their subconscious. This effect is localized; the wearer cannot 
influence gravity beyond their immediate surroundings or beyond objects and 
beings they are physically touching. Because the Gravity Coil possesses an 
infinite energy supply, it can be used continuously without depletion. It is 
important to note that while the Gravity Coil grants gravity-manipulating 
abilities, it does not provide the physical tolerance required to endure extreme 
gravitational pressure. If a wearer overestimates their limits, they may be 
crushed under forces their body cannot withstand, resulting in death. Intrusive 
thoughts can also cause the Gravity Coil to misfire, making mental discipline 
and clarity essential for safe use.

TIMELINE:

Inception:
The Gravity Coil, along with the other Coils of Power, was created as a 
solidified vessel for a fundamental law of physics. It was the first Power Coil 
ever formed, shaped from Bloxite activated by Roblox's own energy. It was never 
intended to be a required component of reality, but rather a "pill" of 
information—something the Bloxiverse could absorb and learn from as it matured. 
The Gravity Coil specifically helped establish the concept of physics within the 
Bloxiverse, as without gravity or mass, all creation would simply drift into 
nothingness. Roblox originally intended to retrieve the Gravity Coil, but 
forgot to do so, inadvertently leaving it behind for the future inhabitants of 
the Bloxiverse: the Bloxians.

Gravity of the Guests:
The Gravity Coil remained hidden for a long time before being uncovered midway 
through the Great Guesticide, a devastating war between the Guests and the 
Noobs. It was discovered by a Guest soldier known as Guest#1204, floating 
within the Miasma. The Guests quickly realized the artifact's immense power, and 
it soon became a central weapon of war. Whoever wielded the Gravity Coil became 
a force of nature. Guest#1204 served as its primary wielder throughout much of 
the conflict, though it changed hands several times after his death. 
Eventually, the Noobs managed to seize the Gravity Coil, shifting the momentum 
of the war heavily in their favor. It continued to reappear throughout the 
conflict until the last known Guests were eradicated. With the war over, the 
Gravity Coil lost its perceived purpose, seen by most only as a tool of 
destruction. With attention drawn elsewhere, it was only a matter of time before 
someone stole it.

Bryck's Lucky Find:
Time passed, and the Gravity Coil changed hands repeatedly. As its legend spread, 
so did fear surrounding it. Many believed possessing it would paint a target on 
one's back. Eventually, interest faded, and the artifact was abandoned—left 
forgotten within a shrub, where it would remain undisturbed for years. Even 
after the arrival of the Robloxians, it remained hidden. During one particularly 
harsh night, a Robloxian named Bryck Manning passed through that very world. A 
faint glimmer of blue caught his eye, leading him to uncover the coil. After 
conducting research, he realized exactly what he had found. Though doubtful of 
his own fortune, equipping it proved the truth. He became the first Bloxian in 
generations—and the first Robloxian ever—to wield the Gravity Coil. Power 
quickly corrupted him, and he developed a god complex, using it to terrorize 
innocents.

Repossession:
Bryck eventually went too far, attacking a peaceful world known as the Farmer 
Sanctuary. This led to Caesar and Nauli intercepting and apprehending him after 
a brief conflict. They removed the Gravity Coil and turned Bryck over to the 
Hunter Association. Rather than surrendering the artifact as well, Caesar and 
Nauli chose to keep it. It was later entrusted to Ren, a scientist with access to 
a highly advanced laboratory capable of studying such an object. The transfer 
was kept discreet, and few were ever aware that Ren possessed the Gravity Coil. 
Since then, it has remained in her care, unused.

THE SPEED COIL
--------------
Color: Red with white specks
Creator: Roblox
Current Status: Housed within the RedCliff Arena, temporarily granted to 
tournament champions

APPEARANCE:
The Speed Coil is a large metallic spring, red in color with white specks 
scattered across its surface. It is warm and smooth to the touch, resembling 
polished stainless steel. Despite its rigid appearance, it is extremely 
malleable and bends with ease. Though it most often forms a spring shape, its 
length and structure can freely reform to wrap around nearly any limb or object.

DESCRIPTION:
The Speed Coil is a divine artifact and one of the three Power Coils belonging 
to the Coils of Power. Like the others, it is forged from Activated Bloxite, 
rendering it indestructible and impossible to recreate. It governs one of the 
three foundational laws of reality: time.

FUNCTIONALITY:
The Speed Coil allows its wearer to manipulate their personal flow of time, 
accelerating or slowing it at will. It accomplishes this by siphoning ambient 
temporal energy and binding it to the wearer's subconscious. This effect is 
localized, meaning the wearer cannot directly affect others unless they are in 
physical contact. As with the other coils, it has an infinite energy supply and 
can be used indefinitely. The Speed Coil does not enhance stamina or physical 
durability. It merely allows the body to operate at accelerated speeds. 
Excessive use can quickly exhaust the wearer or cause fatal physical strain. 
Intrusive thoughts may also disrupt its function, requiring focus and mental 
stability to wield safely.

TIMELINE:

Inception:
The Speed Coil was created as a vessel for the law of chronology. It was the 
second Power Coil to be forged, shaped from Bloxite activated by Roblox's 
energy. Like the others, it served as a "pill" of information rather than a 
structural necessity, allowing the Bloxiverse to learn and evolve. The Speed Coil 
was instrumental in establishing the flow of time itself—without it, the 
universe would have remained stagnant. Roblox intended to reclaim it but forgot, 
leaving it behind for the future inhabitants of the Bloxiverse.

A Speedy Discovery:
The Speed Coil was discovered early on by the Noobs and quickly became one of 
their most treasured possessions. Found long before the Great Guesticide, it was 
treated not as a weapon but as a ceremonial artifact. It became a prize awarded 
in tournaments held at the Nooblet Arena, gifted to champions as a symbol of 
honor and excellence. Over countless generations, it passed between victors. 
Despite how easily it could have been stolen, none ever attempted to keep it—whether 
out of honor or fear remains unknown.

Speeding Into War:
When the Great Guesticide erupted, tradition fell away. Amid the chaos, the 
Speed Coil was lost—only to resurface in the hands of Larkon, a Noobish military 
leader. Larkon proved to be a devastating combatant, singlehandedly destroying 
multiple Guest outposts. His most infamous act was the defeat of Guest#1204, 
during which he claimed the Gravity Coil. Wielding both coils simultaneously, 
Larkon became an unstoppable force. Alongside figures such as Builderman, he 
helped bring the war to a decisive end, eradicating all known Guests. After the 
war, the Speed Coil returned to Noobish custody, though its reputation was 
forever stained by its destructive legacy.

The Modern Day:
The Speed Coil is currently housed within the RedCliff Arena, successor to the 
ancient Nooblet Arena. It is temporarily granted to tournament champions as 
both a reward and a symbol of recognition. Despite numerous attempts, no one has 
successfully stolen it, thanks to the arena's extensive security.

THE REGENERATION COIL
---------------------
Color: Green
Creator: Unknown Scientists (Artificial)
Abilities:
- Incredibly efficient regenerative healing
- Can restore missing limbs and organs
- Channel healing to nearby targets (250-stud range)
- Can be weaponized to cause biological mutations

Unlike the other coils, the Regeneration Coil is artificial—created by unknown 
scientists using the Speed Coil and a live Bloxian as the base. The test 
subject's life energy was sacrificed to imbue it with regenerative capabilities.

The coil has a faint heartbeat. Those who wear it for extended periods report 
hearing a faint whisper, suggesting part of the original subject's soul remains 
trapped within.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            THE R-ORB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Divine Prison
Contents: The Reckoner
Guardian: Builderman

The R-Orb is a powerful artifact created by Roblox to contain the Reckoner. It 
houses an impossible evil with the potential to destroy the Bloxiverse.

Those who get within the R-Orb's range are subconsciously lured toward it—the 
Reckoner's attempt to coax someone into touching it. A single touch would 
release the Reckoner into a new host.

Builderman keeps it locked in a secret bunker and acts as its sworn defender. He 
can resist the lure due to having been a host before.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          THE RESPAWNER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Divine Weapon
Owner: Spawnboy
Creator: Roblox

A powerful two-handled chakram-blade hybrid provided to Spawnboy to aid in their 
reaper duties. The blades hover together to form a Sunspawn sigil design.

Composed of unknown (likely Bloxite) metal. Can instantly obliterate the 
lifeforce of any Bloxian down to their very soul upon contact.

================================================================================
                      PART X: MISCELLANEOUS LORE
================================================================================

BLOXY COLA
----------
The Bloxy Cola soda is a delicious beverage created and shipped by Blox Co., 
renowned universally for its cheap price and delicious flavor. Many Bloxians 
describe it as a mix between typical cola, with a hint of root beer. A splash 
of vanilla can be tasted, especially when the drink has first been chilled 
before consumption.

APPEARANCE:
Bloxy Cola is most often found in brownish-orange cans. The label typically 
displays the phrase "Bloxy Cola" somewhere, and certain cans also display a 
depiction of a younger Builderman. Canned Bloxy Cola is usually sold either in 
packs of one and six. Glass bottles of Bloxy Cola are rare, but not unheard of. 
They have a similar label to the ones seen on their canned cousins, though 
slimmed down to match the physique of the bottle. Bottled Bloxy Cola is only 
sold as an individual unit, never seen in packs or cases.

FUNCTIONALITY:
The Bloxy Cola is designed to quench your thirst on a hot day, or give you a 
splash of flavor when water simply isn't cutting it. The high sugar content, when 
paired with the handful of chemicals used to create the Bloxy Cola's signature 
taste, cause those who drink it to become temporarily invigorated, and even 
restored to health by the drink. The specific formula used when crafting the 
beverage is unknown, and attempts to study and explain this phenomenon have 
failed thus far. Whether these anomalous effects are physical or nothing more 
than a mere placebo is unknown.

TIMELINE:

Inception:
The Bloxy Cola was among the first products to be produced by Blox Co., with a 
formula created by Mr. Bloxton himself. It was released before Blox Co. had 
become a properly-established company, aimed at bringing in a small amount of 
funds to help kickstart the business. Very shortly after launch, the Bloxy Cola 
immediately picked up traction and popularity grew extremely quickly. Blox Co. 
was singlehandedly brought to an enterprise-level status through the beverage 
alone, establishing a large presence for both the Bloxy Cola— and by extension— 
Blox Co. as a whole.

Present Day:
Nowadays, the Bloxy Cola is sold commercially at just about any vendor and 
convenience store that can be found in the Bloxiverse. Even in the farthest 
reaches of locations like the Midzone and Outer Circle, the beverage finds a way 
to make itself available for purchase. Blox Co. has since expanded their 
operations ten-fold to account for the insane demand the product has, with entire 
worlds dedicated exclusively to the mass production of Bloxy Cola alone. The 
factories are entirely automated aside from select workers, specialized elites 
within Blox Co.'s employee hierarchy. Only Mr. Bloxton and his elites are aware 
of the recipe for the Bloxy Cola. This entire time, the recipe has remained a 
trade secret of Blox Co., although it is debatable whether that is due to the 
fear of any repercussions, or due to the raw loyalty of the elites.

WITCHES BREW
------------
The Witches Brew is a tasty seltzer crafted and shipped by Blox Co., made 
famous by the delicious lemon-lime flavor, and the unique side effects that 
come with consumption. Uniquely, although the Witches Brew is labelled as 
"lemon-lime" on most cans, some Bloxians report it being entirely tasteless, 
equivalent to that of water.

APPEARANCE:
Witches Brew is typically packaged in greenish-yellow cans, sold either as a 
single unit or occasionally packaged into a "cauldron bundle" for group 
sessions. They have simplistic labels, with large yellow text that says "Witches 
Brew", often accompanied by a witch hat. It's not often you'll see a glass 
bottle of the Witches Brew, but they're not impossible to find. They have 
similar, slimmed labels compared to what you'd see on a can. Witches Brew 
bottles are only ever sold as individual units, never seen in any packs or cases.

FUNCTIONALITY:
The Witches Brew is mostly designed for thirst-quenching, though it has been 
marketed as a remedy for stress due to the unique side effects caused by drinking 
it. Many who consume it become lightheaded and loose, akin to being drunk but 
without the downsides of alcohol. It can be addictive in large quantities, and 
may impair a Bloxian's senses in the long-term. Despite the obviously-harmful 
effects of long-term consumption, all ages are free to purchase and drink Witches 
Brew.

TIMELINE:

Inception:
The Witches Brew was the second product to be produced by Blox Co., following 
the success of their first product, the Bloxy Cola. Unlike the Bloxy Cola, Mr. 
Bloxton had no hand in the creation of the Witches Brew beyond approving it for 
the market. It initially released to a mediocre response, as little could be 
done to compare to the hype behind the Bloxy Cola. But with time, people who 
consumed it quickly began to realize how good they felt afterwards.

Addiction:
The demand for Witches Brew quickly grew out of control as word got around that 
you could "feel really good" if you drank it, leading to new factories and 
further expansions of the Blox Co. factories. At the same time, backlash rang 
out by many who believed that the drink could prove to be harmful to existing 
societies. Blox Co. made no statements on the matter, and eventually protesters 
got bored of protesting. Even now, the Witches Brew is commercially available 
at many stores, sold indiscriminately to adults and children alike. Blox Co. 
was happy to turn a blind eye in the face of profit, even going as far as to 
release commercials praising the Witches Brew as a remedy for stress and anxiety.

ROBLOXIAN WORLDS
----------------
Personal dimensions created by Robloxians through imagination and willpower. 
When a Robloxian envisions a World, the Heart collapses raw potential into 
reality, creating a new dimension matching their vision.

Only Robloxians can create Worlds—Noobs cannot, with the sole exception of 
Builderman who was granted this ability by Roblox.

Worlds can be destroyed through sufficient damage or the death of their creator.

BLOXITE
-------
A naturally-occurring mineral found in the Bloxiverse. Currently impossible to 
harvest due to technological limitations. The Power Coils are all composed of 
dyed Bloxite.

THE SCARLET FLAME
-----------------
A notorious criminal and pyromaniac responsible for destroying Nauli's World and 
massacring her settlement. Uses crimson-colored flames that can reduce entire 
settlements to ash. Their current whereabouts are unknown.

1x1x1x1
-------
The leader of an occult responsible for creating the Reckoner. They desired a 
complete reset of the Bloxiverse—a grand purge of reality to start anew. Their 
current status is unknown.

ROVAN MACOV
-----------
A sinister bioengineering scientist responsible for transforming Boris Dohm into 
the Bounceman through horrific experiments. He operates from a hidden facility 
and has no ethical boundaries.
