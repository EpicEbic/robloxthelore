                    PART I: THE BLOXIVERSE - OVERVIEW & COSMOLOGY
================================================================================

The Bloxiverse is a coined term referring to a collective of Robloxian Worlds 
and celestial bodies, which have been interconnected through cosmic strings that 
weave the very fabric of reality and hold them together. It stretches out 
seemingly-infinite distances from the center, where a mass of pure energy known 
as the Heart resides. Beyond the interiors of Worlds and other important 
landmarks, the Bloxiverse is devoid of any tangible matter such as air.

The Bloxiverse is primarily inhabited by Bloxians and the various Bloxian 
subspecies, who've spread far and wide across its reaches throughout history. 
Life within the Bloxiverse is chaotic and unruly, as no major forces of power 
exist (or are strong/widespread enough) to govern it or maintain order. As a 
result, many Bloxians have banded together to create smaller-scale civilizations 
or factions across one or multiple worlds, in an attempt to create a sense of 
order or law within such a nomadic reality.

The creator of the Bloxiverse was a deity known as Roblox, who has long since 
disappeared since the inception of the Bloxiverse. His fate is undetermined, but 
many believe him to be deceased or otherwise imprisoned in some way.

The Bloxiverse's total size equals roughly the size of an actual Roblox 
experience, or approximately 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 
studs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        THE SEGMENTS OF THE BLOXIVERSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE MIASMA
----------
The Miasma is a cosmic slurry that occupies the space between worlds, made up of 
celestial residue such as stardust and antimatter. It is present within every 
major segment of the Bloxiverse, existing everywhere that matter (such as air) 
does not. It has no texture and cannot be "felt" by one's touch, nor moved 
through any standard methods.

The Miasma is primordially tied to Bloxians, and reacts to their presence. Those 
that enter the Miasma can freely move themselves within it, attaining a form of 
flight so long as they are surrounded by it. They can breathe normally as though 
surrounded by oxygen, despite no need to inhale or exhale.

The speeds at which they can travel depends on their fitness, equipment, and any 
abilities they may have. Some have even gone on to craft inter-world vessels, 
capable of travelling across entire segments in minutes.

THE HEART
---------
At the absolute center of the Bloxiverse (coordinates 0,0,0) resides the Heart, 
a celestial mass created by Roblox to fuel the Bloxiverse for an eternity—even 
in his own absence. It radiates a pure white light, illuminating the farthest 
reaches of the Bloxiverse for all to see. Reality itself revolves around the 
Heart, depending on it for survival.

The Heart's influence stretches extremely far, as it is interconnected with each 
Bloxian and every Robloxian World that exists (or will come to exist). The 
matter produced and released by the Heart is pure and raw potential in a 
physical and tangible form. When a new Robloxian World or Bloxian is made, 
fractions of potential is pulled from the Heart and "collapses" into a final 
possibility—which is how Bloxians and Robloxian Worlds are made from nothing but 
dreams and visions.

The Heart is integral for the Bloxiverse to function and exist, as the Heart is 
everything just as everything is the Heart. Without its boundless power to keep 
expanding and maintaining the Bloxiverse, reality would inevitably collapse into 
itself. Tampering with the Heart in any form is an incredibly dangerous game, as 
most matter that comes into contact with raw potential is, itself, assimilated 
into the Heart's potential.

THE INNER CIRCLE
----------------
The Inner Circle is the closest segment of the Bloxiverse towards the Heart. It 
is home to the strongest and/or largest civilizations and factions (such as the 
Hunter Association), who govern over the Inner Circle (as it is the smallest 
segment and the easiest to manage).

As the Inner Circle is heavily fortified and enforced by law, crime rarely 
occurs and most civilians live a peaceful and secure lifestyle. Unfortunately, 
as the Inner Circle is the smallest zone of the Bloxiverse, it is unable to 
house large amounts of Bloxians and Robloxian Worlds. The limited space has led 
to it be considered as an elite and heavily-gatekept spot to live, with access 
granted only to significant Bloxians or groups.

THE MIDZONE
-----------
The Midzone is a segment of the Bloxiverse that begins just beyond the Inner 
Circle. It is heavily populated, being the next-best choice beyond the 
prestigious Inner Circle.

Though it isn't well-governed or remotely as secure as the Inner Circle, many 
have chosen to live within the Midzone due to its close proximity to the Heart 
and the major factions that reside around it. Many tightly-knit communities 
exist within the Midzone, working together to prosper and ward off criminals and 
the ill-intentioned.

The Midzone's population is very unevenly distributed, with most living as close 
as they can to the border between the Midzone and the Inner Circle. The further 
one travels away from the border between the two, the more scarce worlds start 
to become and the more risk you put yourself in.

THE OUTER CIRCLE
----------------
The Outer Circle is a segment which marks a turning point between civilization 
and anarchy. It is mostly barren and empty, with occasional (and often-
abandoned) Worlds to be found. The light of the Heart slowly begins to dim at 
distances such as these, giving a darker appearance and atmosphere to the Outer 
Circle. Danger only rises as one continues to venture farther from the Inner 
Circle.

Due to the lack of any major factions, civilizations or consequences for their 
crimes, many criminals reside within the Outer Circle and beyond. They often 
seek out helpless victims who stray too far from the Midzone, either to murder, 
rob, or otherwise bring some form of harm upon them. They are outcasts of 
society or simply do not wish to partake in it, preferring to act only for their 
own benefit and pleasure—even to the detriment of others. Some Bloxians are even 
banished to the Outer Circle, typically if they were punished for particularly 
severe crimes.

THE BANLANDS
------------
The Banlands is a segment incredibly far beyond the Outer Circle, a wasteland 
filled to the brim with dangers around every corner. Worlds are incredibly rare, 
and those that exist often house abhorrent criminals who were exiled to the 
farthest reaches and repent, suffering alone. The Heart's light barely reaches 
such lengthy distances, painting everything inside in a dark crimson hue.

The Banlands are unrecognizably disturbing and twisted, especially when compared 
to populated areas such as the Inner Circle. A red hue fills the Miasma, as far 
as the eye can see. Though the Banlands are mostly empty, those that do reside 
within are incredibly dangerous and often seek only destruction and misery. 
Factions and society as a whole cannot survive in hostile conditions such as 
these, and most Bloxians who enter the radius of the Banlands never return.

THE VOID
--------
Travelling far beyond the Banlands, one will find themselves within the Void. It 
is a desolate, black space that lacks any tangible matter beyond the Miasma. The 
connection between reality and the Heart runs thin at these distances, and its 
light cannot stretch this far. This leaves anyone who enters in a pitch-black 
darkness, with the shine of the distant Heart behind them.

Travel becomes increasingly difficult with the emergence of new problems, as it 
can become incredibly easy to get lost within the darkness. Worlds cannot be 
created this far out, meaning that abandoned Worlds to seek shelter in or loot 
for supplies do not exist. Bloxians grow tired quicker as their connection to 
the Heart thins, requiring more food and sleep to sustain themselves.

THE NULL BOUNDARY
-----------------
Venturing deeper into the Void, mysterious symptoms will begin to manifest and 
intensify as one travels farther on. This means that a Bloxian is reaching the 
point of no return.

At first, these symptoms are negligible and may even go unnoticed by many. 
Bloxians may struggle with their movement, as their bodies almost appear to 
"jitter" in place. They'll start to feel lightheaded and nauseous, struggling 
further with their sense of direction. As time goes on, these effects 
exponentially intensify. The jittering of matter starts to rip flesh and tear 
materials apart, as the minds of Bloxians begin to rupture both physically and 
mentally. It is a feeling of indescribable agony, as though a million hands are 
pulling on you in a million different directions.

If somehow a Bloxian is able to tolerate or otherwise negate these effects, they 
will eventually arrive at a barrier known as the Null Boundary. It appears as 
though it is made of glass, and jitters similarly to matter that ventures this 
far out. Despite being classified as a "barrier", it is more of a one-way door. 
Matter that makes contact with it is immediately pulled in.

Do not make contact with the Null Boundary. DO NOT make contact with the Null 
Boundary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              THE EDGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Edge is a dimensional plane that exists beyond the fabrics of the Bloxiverse 
itself. It is an ethereal limbo created by Roblox, serving as the realm where 
souls of the deceased are processed and put to rest. It is entirely 
monochromatic, existing in shades of grey and white.

The Edge is the domain of Spawnboy, the primordial deity created by Roblox to 
handle the forces of life and death. Only Spawnboy and the souls of deceased 
Bloxians can exist within the Edge—no living being can enter this realm.

================================================================================
                       PART II: THE BLOXIAN RACES
================================================================================

There are three primary races of Bloxians that inhabit the Bloxiverse, each with 
their own origins and capabilities.

GUESTS (Extinct)
----------------
The Guests were the first sentient race created by Roblox, serving as the 
original inhabitants of the Bloxiverse. They eventually turned against Roblox 
and were subsequently exterminated. Very little is known about them in the 
modern era.

NOOBS
-----
Noobs were the second race created by Roblox, designed to be more docile and 
obedient than the Guests that preceded them. They are typically characterized by 
their simpler appearances and yellow skin tones. Noobs cannot create Robloxian 
Worlds of their own—a capability exclusive to Robloxians (with the sole 
exception of Builderman, who was granted this power by Roblox directly).

Notable Noobs include:
- Builderman (Divine powers from Roblox)
- Vortex A. Steele (Chronipulation ability)
- Ren Bytera (Scientific genius)

ROBLOXIANS
----------
Robloxians were the third and final race created by Roblox before his 
disappearance. They are more varied in appearance than Noobs and possess the 
innate ability to create Robloxian Worlds through their imagination. Robloxians 
were born during multiple "waves" of creation, with later waves occurring closer 
to Roblox's disappearance.

Notable Robloxians include:
- Caesar Bloxwright (Electrogravitic Flow ability)
- Nauli Parter (Pathokinesis—augmented)
- Charles Studson (Chainipulation ability)
- Bryck Manning (Uses Gravity Coil)
- Rice Farmer (Civilian, no powers)
- Bloxxanne Whelder (Engineer, no powers)

                     PART III: PROTAGONISTS & HEROES
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          CAESAR BLOXWRIGHT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 24
Alignment: Chaotic/Good
Ability: The Electrogravitic Flow

OVERVIEW:
Caesar Bloxwright is an extremely tall and widely-built Robloxian who serves as 
a self-proclaimed vigilante, dedicated to ridding the Bloxiverse of evil. He is 
a towering giant with an equally-sized heart, deeply valuing his family and 
friends while adopting a protective nature toward those he has grown close to.

APPEARANCE:
Caesar is dressed in a black, white-collared trench coat with a grey bowtie 
clipped at his neck. He has long sleeves which slit into fingerless gloves at 
their ends. He has messily-parted, jet black hair with portions poking out and 
sticking up. Despite having no bangs or obstructions covering his eyes beyond 
circular glasses, a shadow always appears to hide them from view, even if a 
light source is directly shined in his face.

PERSONALITY:
Caesar is a walking definition of both empathy and resolve. He is a loyal 
protector whose heart is as strong as his fists, carrying a deep-rooted sense of 
love and loyalty for those he values. He is very down-to-earth and quick-witted, 
usually capable of remaining calm under decent amounts of pressure.

However, as Caesar pushes the limits of both his body and abilities, the strain 
and sheer power causes him to lose his composure, as sanity slips away from his 
mind. In desperate situations, Caesar has a tendency to enter a berserk-like 
state, drastically altering his behavior and personality into bloodlust, blind 
rage, and sadism.

ABILITY - THE ELECTROGRAVITIC FLOW:
Caesar's ability manifests as a brilliant gold-colored current that radiates 
across his body and clothing when activated. It drastically enhances his 
physical strength and durability while granting him electromagnetic powers such 
as:
- Repelling or attracting metallic objects
- Electrical discharge and attacks
- Enhanced physical capabilities
- Gravity manipulation through electromagnetic fields

The ability puts significant strain on his body and overuse can trigger his 
berserk state.

HISTORY:
Caesar was born closer to one of Roblox's final waves of new Robloxians, cast 
into an already-crumbling society. He fled conflict initially, eventually 
finding himself in the Outer Ring where he created his own World—"Caesar's 
Isle"—a floating island atop an infinite sea.

His awakening came when Exploiters attacked his home. On the brink of death, 
something latent awoke within Caesar—the Electrogravitic Flow—allowing him to 
defeat his attackers. This experience inspired him to become a vigilante, 
dedicating himself to protecting those who cannot protect themselves.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
- Nauli Parter: Close friend and ally, met when Caesar bought her a meal
- Vortex A. Steele: Former enemy, now close friend and ally
- Rice Farmer: Close friend, taught Caesar agriculture
- Bryck Manning: Defeated enemy, Caesar apprehended him at the Farmer Sanctuary

COMBAT STYLE:
Caesar's overwhelming size and bulwark build grant him incredible physical 
strength and durability, making him a slow but hard-hitting tank. His attacks 
carry impressive power that can prove lethal for fragile or unexpecting 
opponents. However, he struggles greatly against quicker targets due to his lack 
of speed and reflexes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            NAULI PARTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 23
Alignment: Neutral/Good
Ability: Pathokinesis (Augmented)

OVERVIEW:
Nauli Parter is a nomadic Robloxian with augmented psychic abilities, traveling 
the Bloxiverse to serve justice alongside her close allies. She operates as both 
an assassin and strategist, known for her split personality that makes her both 
a strong ally and a dangerous enemy.

APPEARANCE:
Nauli is an average-built Robloxian, often seen wearing a grey, white-striped 
tracksuit. She is equipped with a variety of green armaments, including a 
utility belt, scarf, and a shoulder pad. Affixed to the left of her belt is a 
combat knife. She has blonde, bobbed hair with two metal antennae protruding 
from either side of her head—these are the psy-link antennae implanted during 
her augmentation.

PERSONALITY:
Nauli has a distinct split personality:

With Strangers: Cold, cynical, and merciless. She won't hesitate to attack and 
eliminate those she believes to be a threat. She finds no use in pulling her 
punches or flaring her style, believing it is better to be effective than fancy.

With Friends/Family: Cheery, friendly, and energetic. She loves to encourage and 
help those she loves. She likes to remain productive, helping with small chores 
around the homes of her allies even if she isn't asked.

ABILITY - PATHOKINESIS:
Nauli's psy-link antennae grant her the ability of Pathokinesis, allowing her to 
influence and manipulate the psyche of her victims. Applications include:
- Sending mental messages to other Bloxians
- Tuning into radio frequencies
- Inducing various emotional states in targets
- Manipulating behavior through psychic influence
- Reading surface-level thoughts

HISTORY:
Nauli was created during one of the final Robloxian waves and created a paradise 
world filled with grassy valleys and rivers. Her world became a popular 
settlement, and she amassed a village of Bloxians she loved.

This peace was shattered when the Scarlet Flame, a notorious pyromaniac, 
discovered her world and massacred the entire settlement in crimson flames. 
Nauli barely escaped, forever changed by the trauma. She became untrusting and 
cynical.

Later, she was approached by Ren Bytera, who offered to enhance her abilities 
through experimental surgery. The psy-link antennae were implanted, granting 
Nauli her Pathokinesis powers. She then became an assassin and eventually met 
Caesar, forming a powerful partnership.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
- Caesar Bloxwright: Close friend and ally, her anchor
- Vortex A. Steele: Former enemy, now trusted ally
- Ren Bytera: The scientist who augmented her
- Bryck Manning: Defeated enemy

COMBAT STYLE:
Nauli is quick, flexible, and sharp-witted. She is agile in combat and can issue 
flurries of punches or kicks with little warning. Despite her speed, she isn't 
particularly strong or durable, preferring to wear opponents down slowly until 
presented with an opportunity for a killing blow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          VORTEX A. STEELE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Noob
Age: 21
Alignment: Lawful/Neutral
Ability: Chronipulation

OVERVIEW:
Vortex A. Steele is a sharp, quick-witted, and stubborn bounty hunter who holds 
the rank of second-best in the Hunter Association. Despite his small temper, he 
has a good heart and an unyielding dedication to his craft.

APPEARANCE:
Vortex wears signature black gear, optimized for combat and bounty hunting. When 
using Chronipulation, chronological fabrics appear as netting along his limbs as 
his body siphons time.

PERSONALITY:
Vortex is sharp, quick-witted, but incredibly stubborn. He has a small temper 
but ultimately means well. He is incredibly dedicated to his work as a bounty 
hunter and takes pride in his skills.

ABILITY - CHRONIPULATION:
Vortex can manipulate the flow of time around his body, allowing him to:
- Accelerate his personal timeframe for enhanced speed
- Slow his perception to better react to threats
- Imbue his equipment with temporal energy for enhanced effects
- Predict and react to attacks before they connect

EQUIPMENT:
- The Mag-num: A high-caliber magnetic railgun created by Ren Bytera, compacted 
  into a handheld revolver. Features auto-aim, kinetic battery charging, and 
  various ammunition types.
- Amplification Gauntlet: Provides significant strength boost but inhibits speed.
- Both can be enhanced through Chronipulation.

HISTORY:
Vortex was originally contracted by the Hunter Association to eliminate Caesar 
due to a hit placed by Bryck Manning. Their fight ended in a mutual draw when 
both realized their powers cancelled each other out. After talking, they 
discovered shared ideals and became allies. Vortex cancelled his contract and 
the two have worked together since.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
- Caesar Bloxwright: Former target, now close friend and ally
- Nauli Parter: Close ally
- Charles Studson: Rival within the Hunter Association
- Ren Bytera: Created his weapons

COMBAT STYLES:
Vortex primarily relies on his heightened agility, quick thinking, and 
incredible precision. He is a master of body language and can often predict 
movements of targets before they attack. His combat potential multiplies with 
his equipment and Chronipulation.

              PART IV: DEUTERAGONISTS & NEUTRAL CHARACTERS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            RICE FARMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 54
Alignment: Lawful/Good
Ability: None

OVERVIEW:
Rice Farmer (often abbreviated to just "Rice") is a gentle and hardworking 
deuteragonist who tends to the rice crops in the Farmer's Sanctuary. Known for 
his simple lifestyle and positive outlook on life, Rice brings joy to those 
around him.

APPEARANCE:
Rice is a short and blocky Robloxian with pale skin, a blue torso, and grey 
legs. He is always seen wearing a wooden-wicker cone-cap and often carries a 
large rake hoisted on his back. He likes to chew on plants and often has a piece 
of wheat in his mouth.

PERSONALITY:
Rice is a gentle, simplistic soul who loves nothing more than his honest work as 
a farmer. Easygoing and kind, Rice carries an aura of peace wherever he goes. He 
values all life and treats everyone equally and with respect.

Rice has a strong distaste for conflict and will actively avoid it whenever 
possible. He believes it's better to submit and comply when faced with 
antagonism, fearing potential consequences.

HISTORY:
Rice (originally named Ahlias) was born into the Farmer Sanctuary to a loving 
family. He was trained in agriculture from a young age and eventually given his 
own plot to manage—the rice crops.

The Farmer Sanctuary was attacked by nomads who murdered Rice's parents and 
other family members. Though he survived thanks to his brother Tobias holding 
him back, Rice fell into a spiraling depressive episode for years. He eventually 
recovered and adopted the name "Rice" after his late mother's nickname "Ricey," 
and began wearing his father's cone-cap.

Rice met Caesar when Caesar intervened during Bryck Manning's attack on the 
Farmer Sanctuary. The two became close friends, with Rice teaching Caesar 
agriculture and providing moral support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            BUILDERMAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Noob
Age: N/A (Divine Youth)
Alignment: Lawful/Good
Ability: Creation (Divine Gift)

OVERVIEW:
Builderman is the cheery and energetic leader of the Buildermen faction, 
bestowed with divine creation powers by Roblox themselves. He is somewhat of a 
celebrity, recognized for his generosity and incredible potential for good.

APPEARANCE:
Builderman is an average-built Noob wearing a hoodie embroidered with the Roblox 
"R" sigil. He keeps his hood up, concealing a construction worker's hard hat 
underneath. Both wrists are wrapped in cloth. He typically carries the Banhammer 
with him wherever he goes.

PERSONALITY:
Builderman is cheery, energetic, and incredibly pleasant. He values all Bloxians 
equally with highly respectable morals. He can be a bit of a showoff but it's 
always well-intentioned. He tries to remain positive even in tough situations, 
though pushing his buttons can cause him to snap.

ABILITY - CREATION:
Bestowed by Roblox themselves, Builderman can fathom material objects and 
structures in seconds, producing anything from raw materials to finished 
products like houses with utilities. His only limitation is having to 
comprehend and understand what he's building beforehand—he cannot produce 
unfathomable, infinite, or non-existent things.

Unlike other Noobs, Builderman can also create Robloxian Worlds—normally an 
ability exclusive to Robloxians.

HISTORY:
Builderman was one of the first Noobs created and was chosen by Roblox to 
receive incredible gifts—the power of creation and the Banhammer. He was tasked 
with keeping the Bloxiverse safe and maintaining order among Noobs.

After Roblox's disappearance, Builderman continued his sworn duties. He also 
took it upon himself to protect the Bloxiverse from the R-Orb, which houses the 
Reckoner. He keeps it locked away in a secret bunker and will do anything to 
prevent anyone from reaching it.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
- Bloxxanne Whelder: Manager of Buildermen, close friend (and secret crush)
- Roblox: Considers Roblox family after eons together

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         BLOXXANNE WHELDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 35
Alignment: Lawful/Good
Ability: None

OVERVIEW:
Bloxxanne Whelder is Builderman's right hand and the Buildermen's head engineer. 
A passionate and energetic tinkerer, she finds joy in making the world a better 
place one invention at a time.

APPEARANCE:
Bloxxanne is a taller, slim-built Robloxian with ginger-colored hair. Her work 
uniform is primarily black and orange, consisting of a black undershirt and 
orange overalls. She wears a black hat with golden goggles featuring the 
Buildermen logo.

PERSONALITY:
Bloxxanne is a go-getter, full of energy and eager to please—especially her 
superiors. She prefers the solace of her workshop where she tinkers and invents. 
She can grow jealous when others outperform her, fearing she may be replaceable.

Builderman is far too smitten with Bloxxanne to consider replacing her, but 
she's oblivious to this, and he's too shy to speak up.

HISTORY:
Bloxxanne works as a head director for the Buildermen, responsible for much of 
their infrastructure including elevators and hydraulic security doors. She lives 
in a workshop within Buildermen Headquarters, constantly trying to outdo herself 
with each invention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            REN BYTERA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Noob
Age: 33
Alignment: Chaotic/Neutral
Ability: None (Uses augments and inventions)

OVERVIEW:
Ren is a brilliant yet morally questionable scientist whose experiments serve to 
assist her allies. She is jittery, overenergetic, and incredibly pushy when it 
comes to her scientific pursuits.

APPEARANCE:
Ren is a short and simple Noob with black hair bundled into messy pigtails. She 
wears a standard uniform from Blox Co-Operatives' science division and multi-
lens goggles that rest atop her head.

PERSONALITY:
Driven by innate curiosity and fascination with the Bloxiverse, Ren's insatiable 
appetite for knowledge often has her pushing boundaries and partaking in 
unethical experiments. Her obsession with science borders on psychopathic 
behavior. She holds no respect for life she experiments on and has no issues 
carrying out dangerous, cruel experiments.

AUGMENTS:
- Biograft Blade: Projects a green plasma blade from her wrist
- Ion Shielding: 360° energy barrier projection

HISTORY:
Ren was a high-ranking researcher for Blox Co-Operatives. What started as 
harmless experiments grew twisted under her supervision. She petitioned to use 
live subjects and quickly dove off the deep end—testing toxic materials, seeing 
how much of a Bloxian can be removed before death, and worse.

Her downfall came when she created a bomb that killed multiple subjects and 
staff, heavily damaging the facility. She was exposed but escaped by hiding in 
the ruined laboratory, which she repurposed into her base of operations.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
- Nauli Parter: Friend—performed her augmentation surgery
- Vortex A. Steele: Client—created the Mag-num and Amplification Gauntlet
- Bloxxanne Whelder: Rival—envies her position

================================================================================
                      PART V: ANTAGONISTS & VILLAINS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           BRYCK MANNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 28
Alignment: Neutral/Evil
Ability: None (Uses Gravity Coil)

OVERVIEW:
Bryck Manning is a minor antagonist with a power complex, especially after 
coming into ownership of the Gravity Coil. He represents the dangers of 
unchecked power and the cycle of trauma.

APPEARANCE:
Bryck is a taller, slimmer Robloxian with shorter brown hair and stubble. He 
wears a green-and-black striped sweater with belted grey jeans. When using the 
Gravity Coil, he wraps it around his right arm.

PERSONALITY:
Without the Coil: Short-tempered, stubborn, and miserable. He despises being 
"just another civilian" born without special gifts. His hatred has left him as a 
broken man who seeks fulfillment by pushing others down.

With the Coil: Loses himself to his power complex. Becomes unstable, abusing the 
coil freely while remaining ignorant of those around him. His ego and sadistic 
nature shine through as he taunts and flaunts his power.

HISTORY:
Bryck's life was shaped by constant misfortune—every time he'd settle down, 
some force would destroy what he'd built. His powerlessness bred hatred and 
eventually he became a broken, sadistic man.

One night, he discovered the Gravity Coil in bushes while wandering after his 
home was destroyed. His experiments began harmless but quickly turned dark as 
his power complex took hold. He became the very thing he once despised—a 
powerful Bloxian terrorizing the weak.

He was eventually defeated by Caesar and Nauli during his rampage at the Farmer 
Sanctuary. Now imprisoned by the Hunter Association, he works as a laborer while 
receiving therapy. His vengeance against Caesar burns bright.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          CHARLES STUDSON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian
Age: 22
Alignment: Lawful/Neutral
Ability: Chainipulation

OVERVIEW:
Charles is a sharp, short-fused elite operative for the Hunter Association, 
ranking as the third-best bounty hunter. He is Vortex's main rival.

APPEARANCE:
Charles has medium-length messy silver hair. His hunting uniform includes a 
black leather overcoat with metal plating, chainmail protection for chest and 
arms, and a carbon-fiber mask protecting his lower jaw.

PERSONALITY:
Charles is sharp and short-fused, quick to anger when provoked. He's loud, 
egotistical, and self-centered, almost always operating independently because he 
believes others drag him down.

Beneath his aggressive exterior, Charles suffers from depressive episodes and 
loneliness. He pushes meaningful connections away to maintain his public image, 
believing closeness would put both himself and others at risk.

ABILITY - CHAINIPULATION:
Charles can summon and manipulate chains from his body and the local area. These 
chains have incredible tenacity and precision, functioning as grappling hooks, 
whips, armor, extra limbs, restraints, and more. The chains are created from the 
iron in his blood, meaning overuse can exhaust him.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
- Vortex A. Steele: Rival and superior. Charles uses his rage against Vortex as 
  motivation to improve. He secretly admires Vortex.
- Bryck Manning: Ally through shared hatred of Caesar's group

                           THE BOUNCEMAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Robloxian (Modified)
Age: Unknown
Alignment: Chaotic Evil
Ability: Atomic Trampoline (Internal Device)

OVERVIEW:
The Bounceman is a crazed rubber ball who forces unwilling participants into an 
impossible training regimen, often leading to their death. Originally a simple 
office worker named Boris Dohm, he was horrifically transformed through 
experiments conducted by Rovan Macov.

APPEARANCE:
The Bounceman is a short, rotund Robloxian with no arms or legs. He has white 
skin with a red-rubber body and white-rubber bottom. He wears a tailored trench 
coat with flared collar. He has large, bulbous eyes with no visible mouth and is 
entirely bald, though often wears a top hat.

ORIGIN - BORIS DOHM:
Boris was a simple, ordinary man who worked an office job. He was content with 
his mediocre but secure life. During a coffee run, a nearby World exploded and 
debris tore through his torso. He survived but was left comatose.

A man named Rovan appeared, claiming he could rebuild Boris through 
bioengineering. Boris's family signed over their rights. Rovan then performed 
horrific experiments—removing limbs, cooking his scalp bald, replacing organs 
with mechanical components, compressing his skull, installing the Atomic 
Trampoline, and covering him in rubber.

When Boris awoke, his damaged mind eventually accepted his new form with twisted 
euphoria. The man he once was disappeared, replaced by the Bounceman—a creature 
dedicated to forcing others to exercise alongside him until they die from 
exhaustion.

COMBAT:
The Bounceman slams into targets at lethal velocities. His rubber body is mostly 
immune to physical weaponry, protected by thick rubber and a metal skeleton. 
Puncture wounds seal immediately due to the ultra-dense rubber.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           THE RECKONER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: N/A (Host-Dependent)
Age: N/A (Host-Dependent)
Alignment: Chaotic/Evil
Ability: The Reckoning

OVERVIEW:
The Reckoner is the bringer of end times, an unfathomably powerful entity 
created with the sole purpose of ending reality itself. It exists as a spirit 
without a tangible form of its own, requiring hosts to utilize its power.

APPEARANCE:
Formless: A mass of energy shaped like a Bloxian, with energy rapidly swirling 
and jittering erratically.

When possessing a host, the host's skin turns sickly white and features become 
corrupted with black and red accents. The host gains an unending, malevolent 
grin.

PERSONALITY:
The Reckoner has no personality, feelings, or opinions beyond its sole purpose 
of resetting the Bloxiverse. It does nothing but smile, ignorant of the 
atrocities it commits.

ABILITY - THE RECKONING:
- Crimson energy that rots organic and inorganic material on contact
- Radiating aura causes fatal health issues within approximately 17 miles
- Energy projectiles cut through any material
- "Eternal wounding" prevents natural healing of wounds struck by the Reckoner
- Incredible physical strength and speed far exceeding the best fighters
- Nearly unstoppable once it begins its march

HISTORY:
The Reckoner was born from an occult operated by 1x1x1x1, who desired a reset of 
the Bloxiverse. When unleashed, Builderman became its first host. Roblox 
intervened, capturing the Reckoner within the R-Orb and restoring Builderman.

The R-Orb lures Bloxians toward it, and several hosts have been possessed over 
time. Roblox eventually buried the R-Orb in the farthest reaches of the 
Bloxiverse before disappearing. Builderman later rediscovered it and became its 
sworn defender.

                   PART VI: DIVINE & COSMIC ENTITIES
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              ROBLOX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Unknown (Creator Deity)
Status: Missing/Unknown

Roblox is the creator deity who brought the Bloxiverse into existence. They 
created the Heart to power reality, the three Bloxian races (Guests, Noobs, 
Robloxians), and various divine artifacts and entities.

Roblox disappeared after creating the Robloxians. Their fate is unknown—many 
believe them to be deceased or imprisoned. Before disappearing, Roblox buried 
the R-Orb containing the Reckoner in the farthest reaches of the Bloxiverse.

KEY CREATIONS:
- The Bloxiverse and the Heart
- The three Bloxian races
- Builderman's powers and the Banhammer
- The Gravity Coil and Speed Coil
- Spawnboy and the Edge
- The R-Orb (to contain the Reckoner)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             SPAWNBOY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species: Bloxian (Unidentified Species)
Age: Primordial (Timeless Entity)
Alignment: True Neutral
Ability: Spawnipulation

OVERVIEW:
Spawnboy is a divine entity created by Roblox to watch over and lead the souls 
of the fallen to their eternal resting place within the Edge. They are the 
Bloxiverse's grim reaper.

APPEARANCE:
Spawnboy is of average height with a completely greyscale palette. Multiple 
Sunspawn sigils mark their body and dark robes. A Sunspawn sigil is plastered on 
their face around a singular white eye. Two halos hover above their head.

PERSONALITY:
Quiet, reserved, and lacking understanding of Bloxian emotions. Despite their 
cold persona, Spawnboy is friendly and considerate, understanding that most 
souls they interact with need comfort. They respect boundaries and have keen 
emotional intelligence.

The emotional dampening is necessary for absolute neutrality—good and evil are 
treated equally when their time to pass comes.

ABILITY - SPAWNIPULATION:
Complete manipulation of the forces of life and death. Within the Edge, Spawnboy 
can:
- Instantly reap souls regardless of distance
- Generate or dismantle lifeforms at will
- Theoretically heal any wound or restore any individual
- Omnipotent intangibility and omnipresence

LIMITATIONS:
These powers do not function outside the Edge. Since Spawnboy is bound to the 
Edge, their abilities can only affect those who have already died or are dying.

HISTORY:
Spawnboy is primordial, predating nearly every Bloxian including Guests. They 
were created alongside the Bloxiverse and immediately placed in the Edge to 
handle life and death. They have served this purpose for unfathomable eons.

Roblox bound Spawnboy to the Edge because bringing the manifestation of life and 
death into physical reality would cause extinction-level events. Spawnboy has 
never visited the Bloxiverse but has learned about life through the experiences 
shared by souls they've put to rest.

================================================================================
                      PART VII: LEGENDARY ARTIFACTS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           THE BANHAMMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Divine Weapon
Owner: Builderman
Creator: Roblox

DESCRIPTION:
The Banhammer is a cobalt-colored sledgehammer of unrealistically large 
proportions. It is indestructible, composed of an unidentified material. Only 
one Banhammer exists.

ABILITY:
When handled by a blessed Bloxian, the Banhammer can strike a physical target 
and completely erase it from reality. This absolute erasure has almost no 
limitations—mass, density, and strength are irrelevant. Erased matter is 
genuinely gone, leaving not even atomic residue.

Limitations:
- Cannot strike smooth liquids, gases, or raw energy
- Erased matter cannot be restored by any means
- Only those blessed by Roblox can use its ability

HISTORY:
Given to Builderman directly by Roblox to aid in keeping the Bloxiverse safe. 
The "blessed" restriction prevents unauthorized use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        THE COILS OF POWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collection of three legendary coils, each capable of manipulating a different 
natural law. Only one copy of each exists.

THE GRAVITY COIL
----------------
Color: Blue
Creator: Roblox
Abilities:
- Negate or amplify gravity for the wearer
- Adjust gravitational direction for flight or wall-walking
- Localize effects to specific body parts

Composed of blue-dyed Bloxite. The coil itself is weightless and unaffected by 
gravitational pull. Currently in possession of the Hunter Association after 
being confiscated from Bryck Manning.

THE SPEED COIL
--------------
Color: Red
Creator: Roblox
Abilities:
- Amplify or reduce the rate of time flow for the wearer
- Enhanced reaction time and physical speeds
- Near-impossible to hit when accelerated

Constantly vibrates and never sits still. Does not negate aging effects. 
Composed of red-dyed Bloxite.

THE REGENERATION COIL
---------------------
Color: Green
Creator: Unknown Scientists (Artificial)
Abilities:
- Incredibly efficient regenerative healing
- Can restore missing limbs and organs
- Channel healing to nearby targets (250-stud range)
- Can be weaponized to cause biological mutations

Unlike the other coils, the Regeneration Coil is artificial—created by unknown 
scientists using the Speed Coil and a live Bloxian as the base. The test 
subject's life energy was sacrificed to imbue it with regenerative capabilities.

The coil has a faint heartbeat. Those who wear it for extended periods report 
hearing a faint whisper, suggesting part of the original subject's soul remains 
trapped within.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            THE R-ORB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Divine Prison
Contents: The Reckoner
Guardian: Builderman

The R-Orb is a powerful artifact created by Roblox to contain the Reckoner. It 
houses an impossible evil with the potential to destroy the Bloxiverse.

Those who get within the R-Orb's range are subconsciously lured toward it—the 
Reckoner's attempt to coax someone into touching it. A single touch would 
release the Reckoner into a new host.

Builderman keeps it locked in a secret bunker and acts as its sworn defender. He 
can resist the lure due to having been a host before.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          THE RESPAWNER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Divine Weapon
Owner: Spawnboy
Creator: Roblox

A powerful two-handled chakram-blade hybrid provided to Spawnboy to aid in their 
reaper duties. The blades hover together to form a Sunspawn sigil design.

Composed of unknown (likely Bloxite) metal. Can instantly obliterate the 
lifeforce of any Bloxian down to their very soul upon contact.

BLOX CO-OPERATIVES (BLOX CO.)
-----------------------------
Status: Active but damaged reputation

                      PART X: MISCELLANEOUS LORE
================================================================================

BLOXY COLA
----------
The most popular beverage in the Bloxiverse, produced by Blox Co. Features an 
unmistakable design with Builderman on the cover. Tastes like cola with hints of 
root beer and vanilla when chilled. Despite containing no anomalous ingredients, 
it invigorates those who consume it, making them feel healthier for a short 
time.

The Bloxy Cola was Blox Co.'s first product and the foundation of their success.

WITCHES BREW
------------
A lemon-lime seltzer produced by Blox Co. as a hasty follow-up to Bloxy Cola's 
success. Some describe it as entirely tasteless. Side effects of significant 
consumption include dizziness, lightheadedness, lacking coordination, and in 
severe cases—dramatic head swelling.

Developed by Ren Bytera during her time at Blox Co. and was one of many 
unethically tested products.

ROBLOXIAN WORLDS
----------------
Personal dimensions created by Robloxians through imagination and willpower. 
When a Robloxian envisions a World, the Heart collapses raw potential into 
reality, creating a new dimension matching their vision.

Only Robloxians can create Worlds—Noobs cannot, with the sole exception of 
Builderman who was granted this ability by Roblox.

Worlds can be destroyed through sufficient damage or the death of their creator.

BLOXITE

current status is unknown.

ROVAN MACOV
-----------
A sinister bioengineering scientist responsible for transforming Boris Dohm into 
the Bounceman through horrific experiments. He operates from a hidden facility 
and has no ethical boundaries.
