          "Bryck is a short-tempered and incredibly stubborn man. He despises existing as 'just another civilian' within the Bloxiverse, born without any special gifts or latent abilities. No super strength, no anomalous abilities, no remarkable intelligence—nothing. His hatred has left Bryck as a miserable man, someone who rarely finds joy out of living his life.",
          "Despite his tempered personality, Bryck can be remarkably flakey and paranoid—even in situations where no danger is obviously present. His misfortunate life has led him to act this way, his fear and paranoia causing him to believe that something bad is going to happen, simply because it hasn't happened yet. This mindset follows Bryck wherever he goes, draining him both mentally and physically as he always remains on-guard.",
          "Underneath his callous and tough persona, Bryck is a broken man who radiates with hatred due to his own mistreatment. He seeks what little fulfillment he can by pushing down others, in a desperate attempt to feel powerful. By thickening his ego, he can remain numb and drown out the fear and hatred in his heart for the accursed reality he has been placed within."

His (previously-emotional) anxiety attacks and manic episodes become physical, as Bryck gets lost in his power and takes out his frustration physically, destroying infrastructure or injuring innocents on a whim.",
          "On top of his unstable emotions and behavior, Bryck's sadistic nature and ego tends to shine through when he is abusing the coil. He has no issues taunting or flaunting his power to civilians and opponents alike, so long as his confidence allows him to believe that he'll win the fight—and he's often too self-absorbed and high off of his power to believe he'd ever be in a position to lose. Unless issued a much-needed reality check, Bryck's god complex often never runs dry."

          "Bryck has always been on the move, treading from place to place as the years went by. His misfortunate history has deemed it necessary to remain on the move, due to the constant attacks and mass destruction caused by Bloxians up to no good. As of the present day, Bryck has found himself situated within a run-down apartment, residing within a communal Robloxian World located in the Bloxiverse's Outer Ring. The living conditions are far from ideal, but when you're a homeless man seeking a home, it's a bit harder to complain. Somehow, though, Bryck finds a way to regardless.",
          "While he detests living within such a shoddy community building, he fears moving as his effort could all be for nothing if a dangerous Bloxian decided his home would make a great punching bag. Even armed with a powerful artifact like the Gravity Coil, Bryck doesn't trust his combat potential against actual opponents, and prefers to use it against civilian-grade opponents. He'll use it to rob and harass those beneath him, primarily to get various resources he needs for his survival, such as food.",
          "Bryck tries to keep a low profile, but his episodes and tendency for power abuse often find him out and about, typically causing trouble for various victims. When suffering from a particularly strong episode or bad mood, Bryck is known to go out and trash infrastructure to physically vent his frustration. Crashing through terrain and buildings are just examples of the destruction he'll often cause as he expels his energy and exhausts himself.",

His manic episodes have grown to be particularly strong, craving the feelings of freedom he once felt when he held ownership of the Gravity Coil.",

As much as Bryck would love to disobey and laze about instead, he finds the idea of execution far less attractive. At the very least, such intensive and focused work allows Bryck to remain numb to the bad thoughts and feelings.",
          "Thankfully, the prison is not without amenities for inmates, such as the counselling service provided by the Hunter Association's wellness department. Weekly visits with his assigned therapist have enabled Bryck to open up about his mental anguish and sickening life, working on himself and his feelings through emotional training and psychological evaluation. Slowly but surely, Bryck's mentality has begun to improve as his outlook on life has grown ever-so-slightly less bleak. Despite these improvements, his vengeance against Caesar and Nauli remains ablaze."

    history: [
      "Bryck Manning has lived a life shaped by misfortune and uncertainty. It's already common knowledge that the Bloxiverse is a dangerous place for many, but Bryck was truly dealt the shorter end of the stick in life. From birth, he was essentially always on the run. Each time he'd settle down and find a place he's happy with, some force of nature (or a Bloxian with sour intent) would quickly destroy whatever Bryck had managed to make for himself. This routine became commonplace for Bryck, much to his dismay. The severity and frequency of Bryck's assaults would suggest that they were targeted attacks, but this isn't the case. Unfortunately, he really is just unlucky.",
      "Bryck has always sought a means to defend himself, some way to fight back against the cruelty. But as a mere powerless Bloxian, there was only so much he could do. Bryck tried exercising and excessive training at the gym, and while this did help—it was never enough. No amount of physical strength could truly best a Bloxian gifted with a powerful ability, and Bryck came to understand and despise this. Hatred and humiliation bubbled up internally each time he'd be set back by another attack, twisting his emotions and turning Bryck into a hateful and sadistic man.",
      "Of course, this vicious cycle could only last for so long, and Bryck's life would finally hit a turning point. Late at night, Bryck was wandering aimlessly after a recent attack had evaporated his home into dust. Cursing to himself, he took out his frustration on an empty can of Bloxy Cola, as he kicked it around the empty street. But something caught his attention—a glimmer of blue in the moonlight, off in the bushes. Thinking it to potentially be something of value, he approached the bush and pulled out the object. Lo and behold, Bryck was bewildered to have unearthed an artifact, one of legend. Bryck had encountered the Gravity Coil.",
      "As a natural skeptic, he first believed it to be a fake, or some cruel joke planted by a prankster. The Power Coils had been spoken about in many of the history books, what could something so important possibly be doing here? He kept these thoughts in mind and kept his expectations low, and slipped it on his arm. But, no... this was no fake. The coil shifted to fit his arm and locked into place, producing a sound that he could only describe as clicking. Calming himself, he tried to trigger the effects of the coil. Nothing happened at first, and it took a bit of trial and error as Bryck flailed and leapt around like an idiot, expecting the coil to work automatically. But he soon came to understand that it took his subconscious will rather than physical action, and for the first time Bryck successfully managed to trigger the coil and hover.",
      "It was a cascading spiral for Bryck from that moment on, as he began to experiment and test the limits of his own body, as well as the coil's power. The more he used it, the more his sadistic nature began to shine. His experiments began as harmless tests at first—seeing how high he could jump or what amount of intensified gravity he could tolerate. But as things progressed, he began to test the potential it held for combat, destroying infrastructure or attacking innocents. His power complex took hold and grew as Bryck continued to use the coil, eventually becoming consumed by the power.",
      "His original desires for a way to protect himself grew twisted into sadistic revenge, leading Bryck to become the very thing he swore against. He finally had a way to settle down in a home, one he could valiantly protect—but no. That wasn't enough anymore, he had the power he needed and it was time to show off just what he was capable of. The consequences of generational trauma have been realized through Bryck's behavior and actions."

      "Charles Studson - Ally: Though the two aren't close in any respect, they've spent time together in the Hunter Association's holding facility, where the two grew to be partners in their work. They've also bonded over the distaste they share for Caesar, Nauli, and Vortex. It was through Bryck's connection to Charles that a Hunter Association contract could be made against Caesar, despite Bryck being in the Hunter Association's prison.",
      "Caesar Bloxwright - Enemy: Caesar (alongside Nauli) were the ones to successfully subdue and capture Bryck, before transferring him to the Hunter Association's facility. Bryck's petty mindset desired nothing but revenge, though there was little that could be done from inside of prison. Through his connection to Charles, Bryck had a hit placed on Caesar which was eventually taken on by Vortex.",
      "Nauli Bloxwright - Enemy: Nauli (alongside Caesar) were the ones to successfully incapacitate Bryck during his rampage in the Farmer Sanctuary, though Nauli only served to support Caesar throughout the battle. Though Bryck despises Nauli, his hatred was far more focused on the petty revenge he wished to bring upon Caesar instead.",
      "Vortex A. Steele - Enemy: Bryck has a distaste for Vortex after he had failed to complete Bryck's contract against Caesar. While normally it would've ended there, Bryck was enraged to learn that on top of failing the contract against Caesar, he had also gone on to become Caesar's close friend."
