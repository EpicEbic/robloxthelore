Traumatic past incidents have prevented Nauli from creating a new Robloxian world after her initial World was destroyed, leading to her fantastic travels across the Bloxiverse's farthest reaches. Though she lacked a consistent home for the longest time, she met Caesar and eventually settled down in a campsite positioned on his island.",
          "Within the island, Nauli has finally been free to feel peace and security; Commodities that she had rarely had the luxury of experiencing. Under Caesar's protection and free to decorate and expand her campsite as she wishes, she has made quite a comfortable outpost for herself. She'll often go out of her way to assist Caesar with his chores around the island, as a way to share her appreciation.",
          "Despite a campsite to call her own, Nauli still tends to travel around from time to time, feeling more at ease when she remains on the move. She acts as though something bad would happen, should she remain in place for too long. Her mysterious fear is not without good reason, naturally."

Like many other Robloxians, she fled and sought refuge in a Robloxian world of her own creation, born from her imagination. She created a paradise, full of grassy valleys and rivers that ran as far as the eye could see, with clear sunny skies and a crisp, cool breeze you could soak in for hours.",
          "Nauli's world grew to be quite a popular settlement for Robloxians and Noobs alike, as it was positioned in the Inner Ring, a segment of the Bloxiverse highly accessible to most Bloxians, due to its proximity to the Heart. Slowly but surely, Nauli amassed a small village of Bloxians whom she grew close with and lived alongside in prosperity.",

She was revered as a wonderful leader and a beacon of hope for the Bloxiverse.",
          "But alas, nothing good can last forever.",
          "As her World was easily accessible, it was only a matter of time before those with impure intentions would stumble upon her domain. Eventually, this fate came to pass as the Scarlet Flame, a notorious criminal and pyromaniac, discovered the World and her settlement. From then on, the fate of the World and its inhabitants were sealed.",
          "The superheated inferno and genocide that soon followed was nothing short of horrific. Entire portions of the settlement ignited into crimson-colored flames, as helpless innocents scrambled for safety, only to be burnt alive. The rivers boiled as the waters were stained red with blood, before turning black from the ash of corpses and structures alike. Explosions erupted, dealing with sturdier buildings formed of rock and other non-flammable materials.",
          "Nauli, shellshocked and barely holding a grip of herself, managed to barely escape her own World in time, before it collapsed from the extensive heat damage at the hands of the Scarlet Flame. In a mere hour, Nauli's entire life and all of her lifelong friends had been claimed by the crimson fires, leaving her with nothing but the charred clothes on her body and a traumatic experience.",
          "That day forever changed Nauli, and she was never quite the same again. She became untrusting, developing a cold and cynical outlook on life. She stopped caring, and grew bitter to the Bloxiverse. Despite it all, she vowed to never become a monster such as the Scarlet Flame."

She trained and tried to grow from her experiences, becoming remarkably flexible and agile over time. Her prowess and skillset eventually gathered the attention of Ren, a morally-absent scientist who saw Nauli as a perfect experimentation opportunity.",
          "Ren introduced herself to Nauli, and pitched her plan to enhance Nauli's abilities. Though reluctant, Nauli believed she had little to lose and agreed to undergo the procedure. She would have psy-link antennae directly implanted into her skull and brain, with the promise of a large pay and Nauli's absolute safety.",
          "The surgery was a success, though it yielded unexpected results. The experiment was originally intended to grant Nauli psychic abilities, allowing her to send messages to the minds of other Bloxians, and mentally tune into the radio. While this worked as intended, Nauli could now also send out signals through her antennae, enabling her to manipulate the psyche of other Bloxians nearby. Ren was fascinated by this new ability, and insisted Nauli stay put for further testing.",
          "Eventually, Nauli was released back into the world, with her permanent antennae and new abilities. From here, she began to wonder what she could accomplish with a power such as hers. Time would soon tell."

It wasn't long before contracts began to roll in, and Nauli quickly picked up on the dirty work. She was efficient, and no intel remained out of reach through the use of her psychic powers. She found solace through these contracts, rediscovering her purpose that had long-since been extinguished by the Scarlet Flame.",
          "Nauli went on to hone her abilities and eventually became a master in her line of work. She trained and grew to become incredibly efficient with small weapons such as daggers and kunai, taking advantage of her speeds and flexibility to quickly outpace her contracts, and swiftly eliminate those she was told to. Her colder nature made her a natural, and her contracts were dropping like flies. She felt unstoppable, if not for the lingering thoughts of the Scarlet Flame in her mind.",
          "Some time after becoming an Assassin, she met Caesar and the two clicked almost immediately. Their shared morale and ideals made them realize it would be in their best interests to cooperate, leading the pair to collaborate in an effort to apprehend dangerous Bloxians that were too risky to tackle alone."

Though Nauli's skepticism and paranoia wanted desperately to decline the food, her stomach simply could not.",

Nauli admired his noble mission, and quickly realized that the two would pair greatly together, due to their shared interests.",

Nauli's skills and psychic powers support Caesar while he focuses on the offense and defense. Together, very few threats truly stand in their way, though the Bloxiverse always has a bigger fish...",
