      "Roblox was quick to intervene and save the Bloxiverse, capturing and containing the Reckoner within the R-Orb and restoring Builderman's body, reviving him. The R-Orb was far from a perfect prison, however. Those who got within its immediate range would be subconsciously lured toward it, an effort made by the Reckoner to try and coax a Bloxian into touching it. This cycle occurred many more times, with a handful of different hosts who were lured into contact. Though no matter how powerful the adversaries that faced against the Reckoner were, Roblox would ultimately need to save the day. Eventually, Roblox grew tired of this routine and buried the R-Orb within the farthest reaches of the Bloxiverse. It was shortly after doing so that Roblox disappeared forever.",

      "Builderman eventually rediscovered the R-Orb, but was able to suppress the Reckoner's attempts to coax him into touching it as he had already been a host for the Reckoner once before. He took it upon himself to keep any threats from reaching the R-Orb, becoming its sworn defender and using his Banhammer to deter any who were foolish enough to try and obtain it. Should someone successfully come into contact with the R-Orb and awaken the Reckoner, the Bloxiverse may soon face an unstoppable reset."

    abilityDetails: [
      "The Reckoner possesses a deathly, crimson-colored energy that rots away both organic and inorganic material it may come into contact with. Its radiating aura causes a whole slew of health issues for all forms of life, as their energy is drained and their organs begin to shut down. For most, its mere presence is fatal, with the effects of its aura travelling over an incredible 100,000 studs (~17 miles). The closer you are to the Reckoner, the worse these effects become.",
      "For those strong enough to survive its aura of death, its energy can be dealt out in the form of projectiles, including slashes, beams, bombs, and more. These energy-based projectiles are sharp and rigid, cutting and serrating through any material that may stand in their way. Organic material struck by these projectiles suffer an affliction known as 'eternal wounding', permanently preventing their body from healing wounds naturally. It also reduces the effectiveness of anomalous sources of healing, such as the Bloxy Cola or the Regeneration Coil. This affliction disappears automatically if the Reckoner is recontained within the R-Orb.",
