    overview: [
      "The Bloxy Cola is a wonderfully tasteful beverage, a product created and distributed by Blox Co. to all corners of the Bloxiverse. It has an unmistakable design, featuring the Bloxy Cola's logo, as well as a depiction of Builderman on the cover. They're sold in single cans, packs, and kegs for all kinds of occasions!",
      "The Bloxy Cola tastes somewhat like a mix of standard cola, with a hint of root beer. Some Bloxians also report hints of vanilla, especially when the drink has first been chilled."
    ],
    ability: [
      "Despite containing no anomalous ingredients or chemicals, the Bloxy Cola has been known to invigorate those who consume it. Despite its high sugar content, people report feeling healthier and revitalized for a short while after consumption. Whether these effects are physical or nothing more than a mere placebo is unknown."
    ],
    history: [
      "The Bloxy Cola was the first product to be produced by Blox Co., existing before Blox Co. had become an established company. It served as the foundation for their profits and income, instantly becoming an intergalactic success. Blox Co.'s rise to fame can almost solely be attributed to just how successful the Bloxy Cola would go on to become.",
      "Nowadays, it's sold commercially at just about every vendor and convenience store, even in the farthest reaches of the Bloxiverse's miasma. Entire factories are dedicated exclusively to the production of Bloxy Cola, while Blox Co. plants and industrial sites manage the gathering and production of ingredients used in the Bloxy Cola's recipe. The recipe for Bloxy Cola has always been obscure, known only by the prestigious workers belonging to Blox Co. and its owned factories."

    trivia: [
      "The Bloxy Cola is a favorite of many, many Bloxians. This includes Caesar!",
      "The Bloxy Cola's healing property is based off of an old functionality of the gear, where taking a sip would heal the player for 5 health.",
      "The Bloxy Cola is based off of a Roblox gear of the same name."
