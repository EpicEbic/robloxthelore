Despite its appearance, the Gravity Coil is extremely malleable and bends with ease. Though it most commonly takes the form of a spring, its length and shape can freely reform to wrap around nearly any limb or object."

          "The Gravity Coil is a divine artifact and one of the three Power Coils belonging to the Coils of Power. Like the others, it is formed from Activated Bloxite, rendering it effectively indestructible and impossible to recreate. Each Power Coil governs one of the three fundamental laws of reality, and the Gravity Coil is responsible for the manipulation of gravity itself."
        ],
        functionality: [
          "The Gravity Coil can be wrapped around the limb of a Bloxian, granting them the innate ability to manipulate gravitational forces. This is achieved by channeling the law of gravity directly into the wearer's body, binding its control to their subconscious.",
          "This effect is localized; the wearer cannot influence gravity beyond their immediate surroundings or beyond objects and beings they are physically touching. Because the Gravity Coil possesses an infinite energy supply, it can be used continuously without depletion.",
          "It is important to note that while the Gravity Coil grants gravity-manipulating abilities, it does not provide the physical tolerance required to endure extreme gravitational pressure. If a wearer overestimates their limits, they may be crushed under forces their body cannot withstand, resulting in death. Intrusive thoughts can also cause the Gravity Coil to misfire, making mental discipline and clarity essential for safe use."

              "The Gravity Coil, along with the other Coils of Power, was created as a solidified vessel for a fundamental law of physics. It was the first Power Coil ever formed, shaped from Bloxite activated by Roblox's own energy. It was never intended to be a required component of reality, but rather a \"pill\" of information—something the Bloxiverse could absorb and learn from as it matured. The Gravity Coil specifically helped establish the concept of physics within the Bloxiverse, as without gravity or mass, all creation would simply drift into nothingness.",

It was discovered by a Guest soldier known as Guest#1204, floating within the Miasma. The Guests quickly realized the artifact's immense power, and it soon became a central weapon of war. Whoever wielded the Gravity Coil became a force of nature.",
              "Guest#1204 served as its primary wielder throughout much of the conflict, though it changed hands several times after his death. Eventually, the Noobs managed to seize the Gravity Coil, shifting the momentum of the war heavily in their favor. It continued to reappear throughout the conflict until the last known Guests were eradicated. With the war over, the Gravity Coil lost its perceived purpose, seen by most only as a tool of destruction.",

Eventually, interest faded, and the artifact was abandoned—left forgotten within a shrub, where it would remain undisturbed for years. Even after the arrival of the Robloxians, it remained hidden.",
              "During one particularly harsh night, a Robloxian named Bryck Manning passed through that very world. A faint glimmer of blue caught his eye, leading him to uncover the coil. After conducting research, he realized exactly what he had found. Though doubtful of his own fortune, equipping it proved the truth.",
              "He became the first Bloxian in generations—and the first Robloxian ever—to wield the Gravity Coil. Power quickly corrupted him, and he developed a god complex, using it to terrorize innocents."

It was later entrusted to Ren, a scientist with access to a highly advanced laboratory capable of studying such an object.
