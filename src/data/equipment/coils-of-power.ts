          "The Gravity Coil, as with its brothers, is an indestructible spring that can be worn on a Bloxian's limb. It is bright blue, splotched with specks of white across its surface. It's cold and rough to the touch, as though years and years of wear and erosion have taken place. On contact with surfaces, it will often produce clicking sounds, as well as the classic 'boyoyoing~' sound effect commonly associated with springs.",
          "The Gravity Coil is designed to comfortably slide on and coil itself around the limb of a Bloxian. In the event a Bloxian's limb is too big or small for the Gravity Coil's standard size, it will autonomously reshape itself to fit snugly.",
        ],
        ability: [
          "While worn, the Gravity Coil is capable of negating or greatly amplifying the effects of gravity for the wearer. It can freely drop the wearer's gravity to absolute zero, or amplify it with no known limit. However, despite no established limit for gravity amplification, many have perished due to over-estimating their own strength. They're quick to be crushed under impossible levels of weight that they had foolishly believed they could handle.",
          "In addition to manipulating the intensity of gravity, the wearer can also adjust the direction of which gravity pushes on their body. This essentially allows the wearer to fly by rapidly adjusting the direction of which gravity is pushing on their body to push them in the direction they wish to go. This ability can also be localized to only parts of the body, allowing the wearer to climb/walk on flat vertical surfaces, such as walls or ceilings.",
          "In the right hands, the Gravity Coil can be a very effective tool for a variety of different situations. Weightlessness drastically increases one's agility and mobility, while weight amplification allows the wearer to stand their ground or increase the power of momentum-based techniques, such as dive bombing."

          "Like the Speed Coil, the Gravity Coil is a product of Roblox themselves, created as a physical embodiment for the natural laws of space. It serves as a method for a wearer to directly 'communicate' with the concept of spacetime, allowing the wearer to fire off subconscious requests. It is unknown whether this mind-link is psychic, electronic, biological, etc.",
          "The Gravity Coil, as with the Speed Coil, have very little documented research. They tend not to remain in the possession of a Bloxian for too long, as the Coils are highly sought by some of the most powerful individuals. Despite this, a few laboratories and independent scientists have managed to garner basic information about the Power Coils.",
          "Historically, the Gravity Coil has seen many battles and disputes throughout its lifetime. It's commonly deployed in covert, secret operations where stealth and agility are key to victory. It has turned the tides of many, many fights through sheer versatility alone. While only a few of these encounters are documented in writing, many believe that the Gravity Coil is responsible for the victory of far many more instances of combat."

        trivia: [
          "The Gravity Coil itself is weightless, and will aimlessly drift when it is not properly stored or contained. It is unaffected by the gravitational pull of other objects as well, including powerful currents such as those produced by stars.",
          "The Gravity Coil malfunctions if no forces of gravity are present around the wearer. No matter how much they may amplify their gravity, 0 multiplied by 1000 is still 0.",
          "The Gravity Coil is composed of blue-dyed Bloxite, a naturally-occurring mineral that currently has no means of being harvested due to technological limitations.",
          "The Gravity Coil is based on its Roblox Gear counterpart of the same name.",

          "The Speed Coil, as with its brothers, is an indestructible spring that can be worn on a Bloxian's limb. It is a vivid red, specked with white across its surface. It's warm and smooth to the touch, feeling almost as though it's brand new. It passively makes humming and whirring sounds while it's in use.",
          "The Speed Coil is designed to comfortably slide on and coil itself around the limb of a Bloxian. In the event a Bloxian's limb is too big or small for the Speed Coil's standard size, it will autonomously reshape itself to fit snugly.",

        ability: [
          "While worn, the Speed Coil is capable of amplifying or reducing the rate at which time flows for its wearer. By increasing their temporal flow, the wearer's reaction time and physical speeds drastically improve. In most cases, the wearer becomes incredibly unpredictable and nigh-impossible to hit, with capable users producing stronger results.",
          "Alternatively to increasing their temporal flow, the wearer can also choose to decrease it. While this may not have any obvious benefits at first, it has selectively situational uses. It's perfect for simply passing the time, as slowing oneself causes you to perceive the world around you as though it has drastically sped up.",
          "Similarly to the Gravity Coil, the Speed Coil's ability is not just a \"free powerup\" for the wearer. The physical limitations of their body still apply, meaning over-acceleration can cause the wearer to rip and liquify as they push themselves beyond a safe physical limit. This same risk applies when slowing down, as slowing yourself too much could cause you to skip eons into the future, or become frozen entirely."

          "The Speed Coil has little cultural significance, as it has mostly been used in one-off situations by those who have come into possession of it. These users have either died in the process of using it, or have been assassinated the moment they decided to deactivate its power. The Speed Coil has often been used to cheat in races, often found wrapped around the engines of vehicles or hidden under a Bloxian's shirt sleeve."

        trivia: [
          "The Speed Coil constantly vibrates gently, meaning it never sits still when it's placed on the ground, often shaking and rolling on hard surfaces.",
          "Due to the way time functions, both parties perceive the effects of the Speed Coil differently. To outsiders, the wearer drastically speeds up. To the wearer, the world around them drastically slows down.",
          "The Speed Coil does not negate the effects of aging. Through drastic, constant use of the Speed Coil, two Bloxians born on the same day could soon become a biological year apart in age.",
          "The Speed Coil malfunctions if there is not a constant, static rate at which time flows for the Speed Coil to create a base rate, such as places where time does not exist. Such an example could include The Edge.",

The Regeneration Coil can heal severe and even fatal injuries within mere seconds of the injury being dealt. If the wearer's body has been kept in healthy condition, the Regeneration Coil can even restore missing limbs, organs, and body parts.",
          "Additionally to healing its own wearer, the Regeneration Coil can channel its healing power to nearby targets, allowing the wearer to heal others within an approximate 250-stud range (~42 meters). The further away the healing target is, the less effective the healing becomes. The Regeneration Coil will prioritize its own wearer if the coil is being overworked.",
          "Oddly enough, the Regeneration Coil's healing can be weaponized against opponents. If channeled correctly, the Regeneration Coil can \"over-heal\" a target, causing extreme biological mutations and potentially turning organs against their host body. However, this weaponization is incredibly taxing and will often leave the Regeneration Coil inert for several hours following such usage."

It was created by unknown scientists, using the Speed Coil and a live Bloxian as a base for the experiment. Through unknown (and unethical) processes, the test subject's life energy was sacrificed to imbue the Speed Coil with regenerative capabilities, creating an artificial 'third' Power Coil.",
          "Nobody knows which scientists created the Regeneration Coil, or why they decided to create it. Only a few individuals within the Bloxiverse are aware that the Regeneration Coil is artificial, as surface-level examination suggests it's identical to its two brothers. The only major difference is the faint heartbeat that can be felt when the Regeneration Coil is held, leading many to believe that part of the original test subject's soul still remains trapped within."
