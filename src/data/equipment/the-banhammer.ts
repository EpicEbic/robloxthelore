    generalInformation: [
      "The Banhammer is a divine weapon, created by Roblox and directly imbued with a portion of his own power. It was created for Builderman in particular, who is also the only known Bloxian capable of activating the divine powers within. It was made to be an ultimate authority within the Bloxiverse, striking down evil in just one swing.",
      "The Banhammer is revered by many as the strongest weapon in the Bloxiverse, believed by some to even be the strongest thing in existence outright."
    ],
    functionality: [
      "The Banhammer carries a fraction of Roblox's own power, granting it a divine status and an unfathomably lethal ability. With just a single swing, anything can be completely erased from the Bloxiverse—this is regardless of the target's mass or defenses. Erasing something with the Banhammer does not require a powerful swing, but rather it depends on the wielder's intent to erase what they strike. Even a tap to the forehead would be sufficient enough for the Banhammer's erasure to trigger; it all depends on the desires of the holder.",
      "Only a small handful of matter is immune to the Banhammer's effects, primarily gasses and raw energy, as they almost never have a solidified point for the Banhammer to make contact with."

          "Back during the earliest years of the Bloxiverse, Builderman was chosen to become a guardian for the Bloxiverse and assist Roblox directly in its development. Roblox feared that Builderman may receive backlash for being placed above others, so he decided to bestow Builderman with an ultimate tool, one he could use to defend himself. He sacrificed a portion of his energy to create this tool, eventually giving way to the creation of the Banhammer.",
          "Eventually, Roblox presented Builderman with the Banhammer, a tool he could use to both channel the gift of creation, and eradicate those who stood in his way. Builderman was hesitant to accept the hammer at first, against the idea of authority through violence. Roblox reassured him that he didn't have to use it to reign authority over others, and that it was purely a tool for self-defense. This mindset allowed Builderman to warm up to the Banhammer, accepting Roblox's gift and becoming the sole wielder of the hammer."

        description: [
          "Builderman remains the only user of the Banhammer, holding it just as near and dear as he did the day he received it. It has remained visually unchanged, with no signs of wear to be seen—perhaps partially due to Builderman's aversion to using it. There have been a handful of incidents involving the theft of the Banhammer, but no Bloxian could keep the hammer for long without becoming a large target themselves. In the end, it has always found its way back to Builderman, the Bloxian it was made to be with."

    trivia: [
      "Only two people can canonically activate the effects of the Banhammer, that being Roblox himself and Builderman.",
      "The Banhammer is partially inspired by a legendary weapon from Norse mythology, known as Mjölnir.",
      "The Banhammer is based off of a Roblox gear of the same name."
