    overview: [
      "The Banhammer is a cobalt-colored sledgehammer of unrealistically large proportions. The Banhammer's head and cheeks are ribbed symmetrically, while the edges of the hammer have been lined with metal. The center of the hammer has been reinforced, protected by a black-studded brace. It has rubber along most of its handle, for a stronger grip while utilizing the weapon.",
      "The Banhammer is indestructible, composed entirely of an unidentified material—save for its rubbery grip. Only one Banhammer is known to exist, belonging solely to Builderman."
    ],
    ability: [
      "While handled by a capable Bloxian, the Banhammer can be used to strike a physical target, completely erasing it from reality. This absolute erasure of matter has almost no limitations, allowing the hammer to erase targets without needing to account for the target's mass, density, or strength. Matter erased by the Banhammer is not transported or otherwise interchanged, but outright gone. It has been reduced to nothing, leaving not even a trace of atomic residue.",
      "Whilst there are almost no restrictions or limitations to the Banhammer's ability, it cannot function properly in certain circumstances. Certain forms of matter are impossible to \"strike\" with the Banhammer, preventing its ability from activating on the target. Such types of matter include smooth liquids (such as water), gases (such as air), and raw energy (such as electricity).",
      "Any matter that has been struck and obliterated by the Banhammer is impossible to restore. When the hammer strikes a target, the very fabrics of reality that once composed the target also cease to exist, preventing any anomalous abilities from restoring what has genuinely been lost forever."

    history: [
      "The Banhammer is a divine weapon, originally bestowed to Builderman directly by Roblox. It was given to Builderman to aid him in his duties that Roblox had assigned him—to keep the Bloxiverse safe and orderly. Roblox directly imbued the hammer with his own raw power, allowing the Banhammer to surpass even the strongest of adversaries. It was named the Banhammer by Builderman, inspired by the Banhammer's ability to essentially \"ban\" Bloxians from existing.",
      "To prevent anyone but Roblox's chosen from using the Banhammer, a restriction was put into place. Only those directly chosen by Roblox or descendants of the chosen can utilize the Banhammer's ability. While other strong Bloxians may be able to lift and swing the hammer, they do not possess the blessing bestowed by Roblox which enables them to unleash the hammer's ability."

    trivia: [
      "The only other known wielder of the Banhammer is Roblox, though this was for no more than a few seconds before it was handed down to Builderman.",
      "The Banhammer's \"blessed\" restriction is partially inspired by the \"Worthiness\" system from Marvel's Mjolnir.",
      "The Banhammer is based off of a Roblox Gear with the same name."
