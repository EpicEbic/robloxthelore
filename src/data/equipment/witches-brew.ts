    overview: [
      "The Witches Brew is a delicious, fizzy seltzer. It's one of many products produced and distributed by Blox Co. to the masses. It has golden-colored rims, with a bright green backdrop featuring a witch hat. They are only produced as cans, unlike the Bloxy Cola, a much-more-popular alternative to the Witches Brew which comes in bottles and kegs.",
      "The Witches Brew has a lemony-lime flavor, with a hint of pomegranate. Oddly enough, some who drink it describe it as entirely tasteless, as though they've just drunk from a can of water. The reasoning for this is unknown."
    ],
    ability: [
      "Those who drink significant amounts of Witches Brew often report feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness, as well as lacking coordination and cognitive function. In severe cases, some Bloxians have even experienced head-swelling, with their head sometimes doubling or tripling in size.",
      "This is much less of an \"ability\" and more so just a side effect of consumption, with the intensity of the effects increasing depending on the dose of Witches Brew that was consumed."
    ],
    history: [
      "The Witches Brew was a follow-up to the Bloxy Cola, released by Blox Co. in a hurry due to high public demand. It was an effort to hype-ride the success of the Bloxy Cola, and is far from ethically sourced or safe for Bloxian consumption.",
      "It was developed by Ren Bytera, the head scientist for Blox Co.'s (now defunct and abandoned) science division, and was the cause of its shutdown after public backlash following Blox Co.'s exposure on using live Noob subjects to test their (obviously unsafe) experimental products. The Witches Brew was one of these many products, though released anyway as it was towards the end of its development when Blox Co. was outed.",
      "Not much is understood about the ingredients of the Witches Brew, nor why it causes such strange (and potentially dangerous) side effects to Bloxians who consume it. However, it has already become far too well-established to be pulled from shelves, especially when it continues to sell so, so well."
    ],
    trivia: [
      "The Witches Brew is a popular choice for many Bloxians. This also includes Vortex, and it is his favorite drink!",
      "The Witches Brew's head-swelling \"ability\" is based off of the Roblox Gear's functionality, where the player's head increases tremendously in size when the brew is consumed.",
      "The Witches Brew is based off of a Roblox Gear of the same name."
