    overview: [
      "The Bloxiverse is a coined term, referring to a collective of compiled dimensions and Robloxian Worlds, which have been mashed together into a cosmic miasma. These places have been interconnected through celestial strings, meshing the Bloxiverse together through an 'astral net' of sorts. There is no singular, established World or 'hub' for the Bloxiverse, other than the Heart of the Bloxiverse, which resides at the coordinates 0.0,0.0,0.0, otherwise known as the absolute center of the Bloxiverse.",
      "The Bloxiverse is primarily inhabited by Bloxians and their various subspecies, who have spread far and wide across its reaches. It is a very chaotic and unruly reality to live within, as no forces powerful enough to govern or establish law and order exist, giving way to a nomadic and chaotic way of living for most. Many weaker Bloxians have sought refuge within Robloxian Worlds created by themselves or others, and live under the protection of large-scale factions such as the Knights of RedCliff or the Hunter Association."
    ],
    segments: [
      "**Center** - The center of the Bloxiverse is occupied mostly by the Heart, a celestial mass created by Roblox to fuel the Bloxiverse for an eternity, even in Roblox's own absence. Naturally, it is the smallest segment of the Bloxiverse, and is tightly packed as a result. Prominent and well-recognized Robloxian Worlds also exist within this space, such as the Town of Robloxia, and the Red Cliff. The center is widely considered to be the safest and most civilized quadrant of the Bloxiverse. It is bustling with a large community, and is heavily protected by a variety of different factions and orders, especially due to the presence of the Heart. For most Bloxians, the center is the safest (and most optimal) place to live.",
      
      "**The Inner Ring** - The inner ring is a medium-sized segment of the Bloxiverse which surrounds the center. It is populated by a vast number of Bloxians, finding solace and safety due to the allied factions that live relatively close by. It may not be as protected or secure as the center, but it is a common next-best choice for many standard civilians. Despite the general security of the inner ring, it is not without hardships or strife. Evil-doers can occasionally make their way into the inner ring, though almost none reach (or breach) the center without serious power or numbers to back them up.",
      
      "**The Interim** - The interim is a large plane of empty space, existing roughly at the middle point of the Bloxiverse. It is mostly desolate, serving more as a boundary which separates the inner ring from the outer ring. It is mostly desolate, proving to be too remote and unideal for the common Bloxian to live within. The interim marks a dangerous turning point, as those with less-pure intentions often linger within the interim, especially towards the outer ring. It serves as a natural filter, dividing civilized Bloxians with pure intentions from cruel and barbaric ones.",
      
      "**The Outer Ring** - The outer ring lies just beyond the interim, marking the beginning of a 'danger zone' within the Bloxiverse. Far from the Heart or any civilized forces and allies, outcasts and shady figures start to become commonplace. The outer ring is no place for a civilian or those without a means to defend themselves, as they'll be quick to be mugged, captured, or worse...",
      
      "**The Banlands** - Far beyond the reaches of the outer ring lies the forsaken Banlands, a myth among Bloxians. It is believed to house some of the most despicable and horrific criminals, cast far, far away to be forgotten and left to rot for their heinous crimes. Death would have been too kind for them, after all. No imagery of the Banlands has ever been recovered by a Bloxian, as those who have tried to reach it have never returned. To most, it exists as nothing more than a whisper, a campfire story to scare your friends.",
      
      "**The Void** - As you travel farther out and pass the Banlands, you'll find yourself in the void. A desolate, black space containing no matter whatsoever. No life can thrive here, as a Robloxian's connection to the Heart grows thin when traveling this far away. This weak connection prevents a Robloxian's ability to establish a Robloxian World. No natural light or resources exist this far out into the Bloxiverse, making survival and travel almost impossible without careful planning. This lack of necessary resources prevents any civilizations, regardless of their wealth and/or numbers, from establishing any base of operations. While it may seem as though the Void stretches infinitely outward, it does not. It is advised that, under no circumstances, should you proceed forward beyond the Void. If you disregard this warning and try, may Roblox save your soul.",
      
      "**Void: The Null Zone** - As you venture deeper into the Void, you'll start to notice mysterious symptoms as you continue towards the Null Zone, a point of no return. At first, these symptoms are negligible and may go unnoticed. The movement of objects and Bloxians may begin to shake or stutter. Despite these effects, they won't cause any physical harm beyond mild discomfort, at least not early on. Proceeding closer to the Null Zone, these symptoms intensify as reality begins to destabilize due to a weak connection with the Heart. By this point, matter has begun to warp and unravel slightly as it continues to jitter, which can quickly become harmful to organic life. These effects only continue to worsen as an individual presses onward. Having reached the boundary of the Null Zone, the laws of reality and the orders of natural law begin to completely fail. Matter decays, ruptures, warps, and distorts as reality itself has begun to fold in on itself. Distances this far have no connection to the Heart, causing any matter and space caught within this area to rapidly collapse. Organic life will almost instantly perish without some anomalous means of protecting themselves, as no natural armor or technology can stave off such unfathomable effects. Just beyond this space lies the boundary separating the Void from the Null Zone. Do not cross the boundary, though you've already damned yourself by coming this far, so you may as well.",
