    overview: [
      "The Bloxiverse is a coined term referring to a collective of Robloxian Worlds and celestial bodies, which have been interconnected through cosmic strings that weave the very fabric of reality and hold them together. It stretches out seemingly-infinite distances from the center, where a mass of pure energy known as the Heart resides. Beyond the interiors of Worlds and other important landmarks, the Bloxiverse is devoid of any tangible matter such as air.",
      
      "The Bloxiverse is primarily inhabited by Bloxians and the various Bloxian subspecies, who've spread far and wide across its reaches throughout history. Life within the Bloxiverse is chaotic and unruly, as no major forces of power exist (or are strong/widespread) enough to govern it or maintain order. As a result, many Bloxians have banded together to create smaller-scale civilizations or factions across one or multiple worlds, in an attempt to create a sense of order or law within such a nomadic reality. Of course, there is no good without bad; Unruly Bloxians have sought darker paths which has led to disarray and chaos for many.",
      
      "The creator of the Bloxiverse was a deity known as Roblox, who has long since disappeared since the inception of the Bloxiverse. His fate is undetermined, but many believe him to be deceased or otherwise imprisoned in some way."

    segments: [
      "**The Miasma** - The Miasma is a cosmic slurry that occupies the space between worlds, made up of celestial residue such as stardust and antimatter. It is present within every major segment of the Bloxiverse, existing everywhere that matter (such as air) does not. It has no texture and cannot be \"felt\" by one's touch, nor moved through any standard methods.\n\nThe Miasma is primordially tied to Bloxians, and reacts to their presence. Those that enter the Miasma can freely move themselves within it, attaining a form of flight so long as they are surrounded by it. They can breathe normally as though surrounded by oxygen, despite no need to inhale or exhale.\n\nThe speeds at which they can travel depends on their fitness, equipment, and any abilities they may have. Some have even gone on to craft inter-world vessels, capable of travelling across entire segments in minutes.",
      
      "**The Heart** - At the absolute center of the Bloxiverse (coordinates 0,0,0) resides the Heart, a celestial mass created by Roblox to fuel the Bloxiverse for an eternity-- even in his own absence. It radiates a pure white light, illuminating the farthest reaches of the Bloxiverse for all to see. Reality itself revolves around the Heart, depending on it for survival.\n\nThe Heart's influence stretches extremely far, as it is interconnected with each Bloxian and every Robloxian World that exists (or will come to exist). The matter produced and released by the Heart is pure and raw potential in a physical and tangible form. When a new Robloxian World or Bloxian is made, fractions of potential is pulled from the Heart and \"collapses\" into a final possibility-- which is how Bloxians and Robloxian Worlds are made from nothing but dreams and visions.\n\nThe Heart is integral for the Bloxiverse to function and exist, as the Heart is everything just as everything is the Heart. Without its boundless power to keep expanding and maintaining the Bloxiverse, reality would inevitably collapse into itself. Tampering with the Heart in any form is an incredibly dangerous game, as most matter that comes into contact with raw potential is, itself, assimilated into the Heart's potential.",
      
      "**The Inner Circle** - The Inner Circle is the closest segment of the Bloxiverse towards the Heart. It is home to the strongest and/or largest civilizations and factions (such as the Hunter Association), who govern over the Inner Circle (as it is the smallest segment and the easiest to manage).\n\nAs the Inner Circle is heavily fortified and enforced by law, crime rarely occurs and most civilians live a peaceful and secure lifestyle. Unfortunately, as the Inner Circle is the smallest zone of the Bloxiverse, it is unable to house large amounts of Bloxians and Robloxian Worlds. The limited space has led to it be considered as an elite and heavily-gatekept spot to live, with access granted only to significant Bloxians or groups.",
      
      "**The Midzone** - The Midzone is a segment of the Bloxiverse that begins just beyond the Inner Circle. It is heavily populated, being the next-best choice beyond the prestigious Inner Circle.\n\nThough it isn't well-governed or remotely as secure as the Inner Circle, many have chosen to live within the Midzone due to its close proximity to the Heart and the major factions that reside around it. Many tightly-knit communities exist within the Midzone, working together to prosper and ward off criminals and the ill-intentioned.\n\nThe Midzone's population is very unevenly distributed, with most living as close as they can to the border between the Midzone and the Inner Circle. The further one travels away from the border between the two, the more scarce worlds start to become and the more risk you put yourself in.\n\nBeyond the Midzone marks the Outer Circle.",
      
      "**The Outer Circle** - The Outer Circle is a segment which marks a turning point between civilization and anarchy. It is mostly barren and empty, with occasional (and often-abandoned) Worlds to be found. The light of the Heart slowly begins to dim at distances such as these, giving a darker appearance and atmosphere to the Outer Circle. Danger only rises as one continues to venture farther from the Inner Circle.\n\nDue to the lack of any major factions, civilizations or consequences for their crimes, many criminals reside within the Outer Circle and beyond. They often seek out helpless victims who stray too far from the Midzone, either to murder, rob, or otherwise bring some form of harm upon them. They are outcasts of society or simply do not wish to partake in it, preferring to act only for their own benefit and pleasure-- even to the detriment of others. Some Bloxians are even banished to the Outer Circle, typically if they were punished for particularly severe crimes.\n\nWithout a means to defend themselves against the dangers of the Outer Circle, one should never step within it for no reason.",
      
      "**The Banlands** - The Banlands is a segment incredibly far beyond the Outer Circle, a wasteland filled to the brim with dangers around every corner. Worlds are incredibly rare, and those that exist often house abhorrent criminals who were exiled to the farthest reaches and repent, suffering alone. The Heart's light barely reaches such lengthy distances, painting everything inside in a dark crimson hue.\n\nThe Banlands are unrecognizably disturbing and twisted, especially when compared to populated areas such as the Inner Circle. A red hue fills the Miasma, as far as the eye can see. Though the Banlands are mostly empty, those that do reside within are incredibly dangerous and often seek only destruction and misery. Factions and society as a whole cannot survive in hostile conditions such as these, and most Bloxians who enter the radius of the Banlands never return. The few that have survived to tell the tale often receive trauma that no amount of therapy could remedy.\n\nBeyond the Banlands lies uncharted territory that even the most hardened of Bloxians wouldn't dare to visit.",
      
      "**The Void** - Travelling far beyond the Banlands, one will find themselves within the Void. It is a desolate, black space that lacks any tangible matter beyond the Miasma. The connection between reality and the Heart runs thin at these distances, and its light cannot stretch this far. This leaves anyone who enters in a pitch-black darkness, with the shine of the distant Heart behind them.\n\nTravel becomes increasingly difficult with the emergence of new problems, as it can become incredibly easy to get lost within the darkness. Worlds cannot be created this far out, meaning that abandoned Worlds to seek shelter in or loot for supplies do not exist. Bloxians grow tired quicker as their connection to the Heart thins, requiring more food and sleep to sustain themselves.\n\nWhile it may seem as though the void stretches infinitely outwards from this point on, it does not. It is advised to all Bloxians that, under no circumstances, should you proceed forward beyond the Void.",
      
      "**The Null Boundary** - Venturing deeper into the Void, mysterious symptoms will begin to manifest and intensify as one travels farther on. This means that a Bloxian is reaching the point of no return.\n\nAt first, these symptoms are negligible and may even go unnoticed by many. Bloxians may struggle with their movement, as their bodies almost appear to \"jitter\" in place. They'll start to feel lightheaded and nauseous, struggling further with their sense of direction. As time goes on, these effects exponentially intensify. The jittering of matter starts to rip flesh and tear materials apart, as the minds of Bloxians begin to rupture both physically and mentally. It is a feeling of indescribable agony, as though a million hands are pulling on you in a million different directions.\n\nIf somehow a Bloxian is able to tolerate or otherwise negate these effects, they will eventually arrive at a barrier known as the Null Boundary. It appears as though it is made of glass, and jitters similarly to matter that ventures this far out. Despite being classified as a \"barrier\", it is more of a one-way door. Matter that makes contact with it is immediately pulled in.\n\nDo not make contact with the Null Boundary. DO NOT make contact with the Null Boundary.",
