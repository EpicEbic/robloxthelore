      "<strong><u>The Lore is a planned (and upcoming) webcomic inspired by— and taking place within— the Roblox universe.</u></strong> The story follows our protagonists: Caesar, Nauli, and Vortex. They're on a journey to end chaos and disorder within the Bloxiverse, mastering their powers and meeting plenty of allies and enemies along the way!",
      "There is no official webcomic yet, but the story can be unravelled by exploring the website and reading the available entries! The website is updated as soon as new content is available. The webcomic itself will be hosted on this site once production on it has begun!"

      "<strong><u>As of writing, I (EpicEbic) am the sole project owner and director, any text and images you see are made by me!</u></strong> I'm unsure if this project will remain exclusively worked on by me, but for the forseeable future I will be the only man behind The Lore."

    question: "How does this project use AI?",
    answer: [
      "I would like to immediately clarify, <strong><u>The Lore does NOT make use of generative AI in any shape or form for the story content, including text and imagery. All writing and images are original, done by me (EpicEbic) and me alone.</u></strong>",
      "<strong><u>That being said, a small handful of AI assistants have been used to help develop the website you're currently browsing</u></strong>, as I lack the coding experience necessary to make a functioning website that I'd be happy with. I assure you, I detest AI as much as the next person, but this help was necessary if I didn't want to spend years figuring out coding to reach a level I'd be happy making a website with.",
      "<strong><u>There are NO plans to apply AI anywhere beyond the development of the website</u></strong>, I do not believe in AI replacing human creativity. <strong><u>The Lore's characters and world will always remain untouched by AI, that is a promise.</u></strong>"
