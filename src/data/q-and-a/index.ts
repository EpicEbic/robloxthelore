    answer: [
      "<strong><u>The Lore is a planned (and upcoming) webcomic inspired by— and taking place within— the Roblox universe.</u></strong> The story follows our protagonists: Caesar, Nauli, and Vortex. They're on a journey to end chaos and disorder within the Bloxiverse, mastering their powers and meeting plenty of allies and enemies along the way!",
      "There is no official webcomic yet, but the story can be unravelled by exploring the website and reading the available entries! The website is updated as soon as new content is available. The webcomic itself will be hosted on this site once production on it has begun!"

    answer: [
      "<strong><u>As of writing, I (EpicEbic) am the sole project owner and director. Any text and imagery seen within this website is made exclusively by me!</u></strong> This may change in the future, but for now I will be the only man behind The Lore."

    question: "How does this project use AI?",
    answer: [
      "I would like to clarify right away, <strong><u>The Lore does NOT make use of generative AI for any aspects of the story, all work (text and imagery) is done by me (EpicEbic) and me alone.</u></strong>",
      "<strong><u>I will clearly state that the website you're currently browsing has been partially co-developed with AI</u></strong>, as I lack the required experience as a coder to create a website I'd be satisfied with. I wish I did not have to use this tool, but it was necessary for this website to exist.",
      "<strong><u>There are NO plans to apply AI anywhere beyond the development of the website, The Lore as a series will remain untouched by any AI, whatsoever.</u></strong> I do not believe in AI replacing human creativity."
