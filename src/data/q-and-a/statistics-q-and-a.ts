    question: "How accurate are the statistics?",
    answer: [
      "While statistics accurately reflect the strengths and weaknesses of each character, they are not to be taken too seriously. They serve more as an estimate and general round-up of a character's strength, rather than a direct and fully-accurate portrayal of their capabilities."

    id: "will-higher-stats-always-win",
    question: "Will a character with higher stats always defeat another character?",
    answer: [
      "No! While it is true that characters who perform better overall may have better odds of winning against another in battle, it also varies heavily depending on the character themselves.",
      "A character might have strong physical range, but are outclassed by others who can attack at a distance, even if they are weaker. A slower character who is stronger may struggle to strike a weaker but faster character. These are just some of many examples."
